'' he added , `` a person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators . '' robin 's comments follow claims by two magazines , german daily bild and french paris match , of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board germanwings flight 9525 as it crashed into the french alps . all 150 on board were killed . paris match and bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site . the two publications described the supposed video , but did not post it on their websites . the publications said that they watched the video , which was found by a source close to the investigation . `` one can hear cries of ` my god ' in several languages , '' paris match reported . `` metallic banging can also be heard more than three times , perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object . towards the end , after a heavy shake , stronger than the others , the screaming intensifies . then nothing . '' `` it is a very disturbing scene , '' said julian reichelt , editor-in-chief of bild online . an official with france 's accident investigation agency , the bea , said the agency is not aware of any such video . lt. col. jean-marc menichini , a french gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the germanwings crash site , told cnn that the reports were `` completely wrong '' and `` unwarranted . '' cell phones have been collected at the site , he said , but that they `` had n't been exploited yet . '' menichini said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the criminal research institute in rosny sous-bois , near paris , in order to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand-in-hand with investigators . but none of the cell phones found so far have been sent to the institute , menichini said . asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media , menichini answered with a categorical `` no . '' reichelt told `` erin burnett : outfront '' that he had watched the video and stood by the report , saying bild and paris match are `` very confident '' that the clip is real . he noted that investigators only revealed they 'd recovered cell phones from the crash site after bild and paris match published their reports . `` that is something we did not know before . ... overall we can say many things of the investigation were n't revealed by the investigation at the beginning , '' he said . what was mental state of germanwings co-pilot ? german airline lufthansa confirmed tuesday that co-pilot andreas lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of germanwings flight 9525 , which he 's accused of deliberately crashing last week in the french alps . lubitz told his lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a `` previous episode of severe depression , '' the airline said tuesday . email correspondence between lubitz and the school discovered in an internal investigation , lufthansa said , included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training . the announcement indicates that lufthansa , the parent company of germanwings , knew of lubitz 's battle with depression , allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit . lufthansa , whose ceo carsten spohr previously said lubitz was 100 % fit to fly , described its statement tuesday as a `` swift and seamless clarification '' and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors . spohr traveled to the crash site wednesday , where recovery teams have been working for the past week to recover human remains and plane debris scattered across a steep mountainside . he saw the crisis center set up in seyne-les-alpes , laid a wreath in the village of le vernet , closer to the crash site , where grieving families have left flowers at a simple stone memorial . menichini told cnn late tuesday that no visible human remains were left at the site but recovery teams would keep searching . french president francois hollande , speaking tuesday , said that it should be possible to identify all the victims using dna analysis by the end of the week , sooner than authorities had previously suggested . in the meantime , the recovery of the victims ' personal belongings will start wednesday , menichini said . among those personal belongings could be more cell phones belonging to the 144 passengers and six crew on board . check out the latest from our correspondents . the details about lubitz 's correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and lubitz 's possible motive for downing the jet . a lufthansa spokesperson told cnn on tuesday that lubitz had a valid medical certificate , had passed all his examinations and `` held all the licenses required . '' earlier , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in dusseldorf , christoph kumpa , said medical records reveal lubitz suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot 's license . kumpa emphasized there 's no evidence suggesting lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash . investigators are looking into whether lubitz feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot 's license , a european government official briefed on the investigation told cnn on tuesday . while flying was `` a big part of his life , '' the source said , it 's only one theory being considered . another source , a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation , also told cnn that authorities believe the primary motive for lubitz to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems . lubitz 's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist , both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues , the european government official said . but no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles , there 's more to the story , said brian russell , a forensic psychologist . `` psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they were n't going to keep doing their job and they 're upset about that and so they 're suicidal , '' he said . `` but there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person 's problems .

'' later that month , the icc opened a preliminary examination into the situation in palestinian territories , paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against israelis . as members of the court , palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well . israel and the united states , neither of which is an icc member , opposed the palestinians ' efforts to join the body . but palestinian foreign minister riad al-malki , speaking at wednesday 's ceremony , said it was a move toward greater justice . `` as palestine formally becomes a state party to the rome statute today , the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice , '' he said , according to an icc news release . `` indeed , today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace . '' judge kuniko ozaki , a vice president of the icc , said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the palestinians . `` as the rome statute today enters into force for the state of palestine , palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a state party to the statute . these are substantive commitments , which can not be taken lightly , '' she said . rights group human rights watch welcomed the development . `` governments seeking to penalize palestine for joining the icc should immediately end their pressure , and countries that support universal acceptance of the court 's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership , '' said balkees jarrah , international justice counsel for the group . `` what 's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice , not palestine 's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members . '' in january , when the preliminary icc examination was opened , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu described it as an outrage , saying the court was overstepping its boundaries . the united states also said it `` strongly '' disagreed with the court 's decision . `` as we have said repeatedly , we do not believe that palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the icc , '' the state department said in a statement . it urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations . `` we will continue to oppose actions against israel at the icc as counterproductive to the cause of peace , '' it said . but the icc begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as `` palestine . '' while a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation , it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides . prosecutor fatou bensouda said her office would `` conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality .

'' the report , `` death sentences and executions 2014 , '' cites the example of pakistan lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in peshawar in december . china is also mentioned , as having used the death penalty as a tool in its `` strike hard '' campaign against terrorism in the restive far-western province of xinjiang . the annual report catalogs the use of state-sanctioned killing as a punitive measure across the globe , and this year 's edition contains some mixed findings . on one hand , the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22 % on the previous year . at least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014 , compared to 778 in 2013 . amnesty 's figures do not include statistics on executions carried out in china , where information on the practice is regarded as a state secret . belarus and vietnam , too , do not release data on death penalty cases . `` the long-term trend is definitely positive -- we are seeing a decrease in the number of executions -lrb- worldwide -rrb- , '' audrey gaughran , amnesty 's director of global issues , told cnn . `` a number of countries are closer to abolition , and there are some signs that some countries will be abolitionist by 2015 . -lrb- there are -rrb- signals of a world that is nearing abolition . '' while the report notes some encouraging signs , it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014 . at least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year , an increase of 28 % compared with 2013 . the report notes that the spike in sentencing is attributable to mass-sentencing in countries including egypt and nigeria , `` against scores of people in some cases . '' the organization found `` positive developments '' worldwide , with most regions seeming to show reductions in the number of executions . opinion : sharp spike in death sentences . sub-saharan africa , for example , saw a 28 % fall in reported cases , and executions recorded in the middle east and north africa were down 23 % compared to 2013 . `` even though we 've highlighted some of the negative developments ... i think we would always highlight that there are positive developments , '' gaughran said . `` across the board , with the exception of europe and central asia there were fewer reports of executions in every region . '' the resumption of the use of capital punishment in belarus -- the only country in europe and central asia to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an near-universal decrease in countries using the death penalty by region . the united states has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the americas to conduct executions , but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly , from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014 . the state of washington also imposed a moratorium on executions last year . the u.s. remains one of the worst offenders for imposing capital punishment , with only iran -lrb- 289 + -rrb- , iraq -lrb- 61 + -rrb- , and saudi arabia -lrb- 90 + -rrb- executing more people in 2014 . while figures are not available , amnesty estimates that china also executes `` thousands '' of prisoners each year , `` more than the rest of the world put together . '' the report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death . `` in the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed , the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards , '' the report stated . `` in 2014 amnesty international raised particular concerns in relation to court proceedings in afghanistan , bangladesh , china , egypt , iran , iraq , north korea , pakistan , saudi arabia and sri lanka . '' the united nations secretary-general , ban ki-moon , last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment . `` the taking of life is too irreversible for one human being to inflict it on another , '' he said , in marking world day against death penalty in october . `` we must continue to argue strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights . '' amnesty estimates that at least 19,094 people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014 .
<s> amnesty international releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide ; much of it makes for grim reading . </s> <s> salil shetty : countries that use executions to deal with problems are on the wrong side of history . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- on may 28 , 2014 , some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in china 's northwestern xinjiang region . but they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event . instead , the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits . armed soldiers guarded the exits . in the patently unfair , open air trial that followed , 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed . three were sentenced to death . the public mass sentencing was part a china 's `` strike hard '' campaign against unrest in xinjiang , a campaign the government claims was launched to combat `` terrorism '' and `` separatism . '' but it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided , and often cynical , attempt to tackle crime and terrorism . today , amnesty international releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide . much of it makes for grim reading . in pakistan , the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific taliban attack on a school in peshawar in december . more than 60 people have been put to death since , and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows . iran and iraq executed people for `` terrorism , '' and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes . in a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before , governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism . other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates . jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in december , putting 11 murder convicts to death , with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime . in indonesia , authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety `` national emergency . '' six people have already been executed this year . a sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool . the rise was largely because of developments in egypt and nigeria , where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict . the simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both . there is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence , as united nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed . it is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough . at amnesty international , we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades . thankfully , most of the world now appears to agree with us . the numbers speak for themselves . in 1945 when the united nations was founded , only eight countries had abolished the death penalty . today , 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice . last year , we recorded executions in 22 countries , down by almost a half from 20 years ago . despite the troubling developments we recorded last year , there was still much good news to be found . the number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year , from 778 to 607 . this number does not include china , where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together , but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret , the true figure is impossible to determine . executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-saharan africa -- equatorial guinea , somalia and sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter . the americas continued to be execution-free , apart from the united states . those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history . they must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment . fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task , but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment . with determination , i know that we can achieve this goal .

<s> the rev. robert schuller , 88 , had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer in 2013 . </s> <s> his tv show , `` hour of power , '' was enormously popular in the 1970s and 1980s . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- the rev. robert h. schuller , california televangelist and founder of the television ministry `` hour of power , '' died thursday , according to his family . he was 88 years old . schuller , also the founder of crystal cathedral megachurch , had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer in august 2013 , a release from `` hour of power '' said . `` my father-in-law passed away peacefully early this morning . he was a great dad and a great man of god , '' said schuller 's daughter-in-law , donna schuller , in a twitter message . schuller 's life followed an almost shakespearean arc . he was born in a iowa farmhouse without running water and longed to preach from his earliest days . in his autobiography , `` prayer : my soul 's adventure with god , '' he described standing alone by a river and picturing himself delivering sermons to a rapt congregation . after attending a hope college and western theological seminary in michigan , he met his wife of more than 60 years , arvella , while preaching at her church -lrb- she was the organist -rrb- . with their young family in tow , the schullers caravanned west to california , where he rented a drive-in theater and preached from the roof of the snack bar . it was beneath the dignity of christian ministry , some local pastors huffed . the `` passion pits '' where teenagers necked was no place for the gospel . schuller was undeterred , and he quickly outgrew the drive-in . he called the explosive growth of his tiny congregation a `` miracle , '' though his many mainstream critics had other names for it . his confident , breezy version of christianity -- too breezy , by some estimations -- drew hordes of seekers and lapsed christians who were put off by the hellfire fulminations of many post-war american preachers . schuller sold a softer , gentler message , which borrowed heavily , he acknowledged , from the father of the feel-good gospel , norman vincent peale . he preached not to convert or condemn people , but to encourage them , a sentiment he called `` possibility thinking . '' people loved it . `` evangelicalism at its best wants to be innovative and reach people , '' said timothy larsen , a professor of christian thought at wheaton college in illinois . `` and schuller was a master at that . '' `` what he got right is that the gospel is good news , '' larsen continued . `` and he preached an uplifting message about personal transformation and uplift and hope . '' some of schuller 's favored phrases , though , struck others as cornpone christianity . `` turn your hurt into a halo ? '' said randall balmer , a professor of american religious history at dartmouth college , citing one such phrase . `` that 's pretty weak tea . '' still , balmer gives schuller some credit . `` it may be bad theology , but it 's brilliant marketing . '' in 1970 , schuller began broadcasting `` hour of power , '' believed to be one of the first , if not the very first , sunday service to be shown regularly on television . with his genial smile , priestly robes and gray hair , he looked and talked like a guy who wanted nothing more than to see his flock succeed . the show , which ran for decades , reached millions , making schuller a televangelist before the term became tarnished by the sins of his many successors . schuller 's crowning achievement , at least architecturally , still stands in orange county , california , though it is now owned by the roman catholic church . the crystal cathedral , a great gleaming edifice with 10,000 glass panels , gave worshipers a look at the clouds that house the heavens , while schuller preached in the pulpit below . the message was clear to many : the road to the former ran through the latter . during the 1980s and 1990s , schuller 's star continued to rise , with presidents stopping by the crystal cathedral -- often during campaigns , it should be said -- and future megachurch pastors like rick warren and bill hybels seeking his advice . as schuller aged , though , his family was beset by a succession scandal straight from the pages of `` king lear . '' he tried to install his only son , bobby jr. , as pastor of crystal cathedral . but the preaching styles of father and son were too different for the congregation -- measured at times at 10,000 strong -- to countenance . bobby schuller jr. left `` hour of power '' and the pulpit at crystal cathedral after a short time . as the family searched for a new successor and tussled over finances , viewers and donations to the church and its television show dropped precipitously . crystal cathedral ministries filed for bankruptcy in 2010 , citing debts of more than $ 43 million , according to the associated press . schuller 's empire , which once soared as high as his glassy cathedral , had fallen to dust . eventually , schuller 's grandson , also named bobby , took over `` hour of power , '' though at a different church . in a statement on thursday , the younger schuller recalled standing atop crystal cathedral 's 12-story tower of hope with his grandfather as they surveyed the surrounding landscape . `` you could see the whole world from there , '' he said . people we 've lost in 2015 . cnn 's stella chan reported from los angeles .

'' theia is only one year old but the dog 's brush with death did not leave her unscathed . she suffered a dislocated jaw , leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe . the veterinary hospital 's good samaritan fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog 's treatment , but mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog 's care . she 's also created a facebook page to keep supporters updated . donors have already surpassed the $ 10,000 target , inspired by theia 's tale of survival against the odds . on the fundraising page , mellado writes , `` she is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw . i agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home . '' she is dedicated to making sure theia gets the medical attention she needs , mellado adds , and wants to `` make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again ! '' any additional funds raised will be `` paid forward '' to help other animals . theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks . a cat in tampa , florida , found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in january , showed up alive in a neighbor 's yard five days after he was buried by his owner . the cat was in bad shape , with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye , but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the humane society .

'' and , perhaps to her surprise , pelosi got a response . `` iran never denied it , '' zarif tweeted back . `` the man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone . happy new year . '' the reference was likely to former iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who had left office the previous month . zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by ahmadinejad 's successor , hassan rouhami . his foreign ministry notes , perhaps defensively , that `` due to the political and security conditions of the time , he decided to continue his education in the united states . '' that is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the shah of iran , which began in 1977 , and during the iranian revolution , which drove the shah from power in 1979 . zarif left the country in 1977 , received his undergraduate degree from san francisco state university in 1981 , his master 's in international relations from the university of denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the university of denver in 1988 . both of his children were born in the united states . the website of the iranian foreign ministry , which zarif runs , can not even agree with itself on when he was born . the first sentence of his official biography , perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in tehran , says zarif was `` born to a religious traditional family in tehran in 1959 . '' later on the same page , however , his date of birth is listed as january 8 , 1960 . and the iranian diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 . so he is 54 , 55 or maybe even 56 . whichever , he is still considerably younger than his opposite number , kerry , who is 71 . the feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the alavi foundation , a charitable organization . the u.s. justice department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the iranian government to launder money and get around u.s. sanctions . but last year , a settlement in the case , under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in manhattan along with other properties to the u.s. government , did not mention zarif 's name . early in the iranian revolution , zarif was among the students who took over the iranian consulate in san francisco . the aim , says the website iranian.com -- which cites zarif 's memoirs , titled `` mr. ambassador '' -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently islamic . later , the website says , zarif went to make a similar protest at the iranian mission to the united nations . in response , the iranian ambassador to the united nations offered him a job . in fact , he has now spent more time with kerry than any other foreign minister in the world . and that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men , with help from other foreign ministers as well , try to meet a june 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in switzerland .

<s> americans paid more for some fruits and vegetables last year because of the drought . </s> <s> tourists will now have to ask for a glass of water at a california restaurant . </s> <s> perhaps the only good thing is another `` great '' wine grape harvest last year . </s><sec>los angeles -lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's more than just one state 's internal problem . the historic california drought hurts the rest of the union , too . that 's because california is a breadbasket to the nation , growing more than a third of its vegetables and nearly two-thirds of its fruits and nuts . here 's why we should heed the ongoing drought in the most populous state , a slowly expanding natural disaster now in its fourth year that this week prompted gov. jerry brown to announce a mandatory 25 % cutback in water consumption in all cities . in 2014 , one expert predicted consumers would pay more for some groceries because of the california drought . he was often right , according to statistics gathered by timothy richards , agribusiness professor at arizona state university . prices rose last year for these items on your kitchen table : . • berries rose in price by about 80 cents per clamshell to $ 3.88 . • broccoli by 11 cents per pound to $ 1.89 . • grapes by 64 cents a pound to $ 3.06 . • melons by 24 cents a pound to $ 1.23 . • packaged salad by 23 cents a bag to $ 2.91 . • peppers by 26 cents a pound to $ 2.39 . though fruits and vegetable prices fell in february , overall prices are expected to rise this year , because of inflation , u.s. department of agriculture economist annemarie kuhns said . fresh fruit prices are projected to rise between 2.5 % and 3.5 % , and vegetables between 2 % and 3 % , close to historical average increases , kuhns said . whether the california drought will affect food prices again this year is unknown , thanks to a strong dollar . the greenback 's strength allows producers to import crops that may be withering under the absence of west coast rain or other misfortunes elsewhere in the nation , kuhns said . moreover , the drop in oil prices also eases the cost of transporting food from california to the other 49 states , she said . what economists do n't know yet is whether farmers will plant fewer crops because of the drought . those decisions are now being made in the field and could boost supermarket prices , she said . `` the drought in california does have the potential to impact the price we pay for fresh fruit and fresh vegetables and dairy and fresh eggs we pay at the counter , '' kuhns said . `` we are not sure what the exact impact will be . '' the reality is there 's a major drought throughout the west and southwest . while not as bad as california , texas and oklahoma are also seeing extreme and exceptional drought -- the two worst categories -- in several parts of their states , the u.s. drought monitor said this week . overall , the western drought affects more than 52 million people , the monitor says . as a result , consumers paid a whopping extra 12.1 % for beef and veal in 2014 , the usda reports . straining under a drought that began in 2012 , ranchers in texas and oklahoma last year saw smaller grazing pastures , paid more for feed , and experienced difficulties accessing water to cool their cattle . so the cattlemen began culling their herds , kuhns said . this year 's beef and veal prices should rise only by 6 % at most , still higher than the 4.1 % historical average , the feds project . but beef prices offer an object lesson about the drought . `` there 's other areas being affected , '' kuhns said . it 's called the golden state for the gold rush of yore , but let 's face it : the rest of the nation flocks to california for vacation because of another golden reason . its year-round sunshine . so the next time you take a holiday in california , you 'll find a few changes around here , thanks to the drought . like asking for a glass of water at a restaurant . you wo n't find water waiting for you on the table . eateries now `` can only serve water to customers on request , '' the state water resources control board declared in march under expanded emergency regulations . tourists can also expect to hear a lot of requests at hotels about whether they want their linens and towels laundered daily . these requests are mandatory under the new regulations . and they 'll see fewer homes running decorative fountains . because much of the snowpack in the sierra nevada has alarmingly disappeared , many ski resorts shut down early this year , including at lake tahoe , and some are now building zip lines , mountain bike trails and wedding venues to keep tourists coming , the sacramento bee reported . `` if the drought continues through next winter and we do not conserve more , the consequences could be even more catastrophic than they already are , '' state water board chair felicia marcus said in march . but what about those yummy california wines , you ask ? guess what . they 're only getting better -- because of the drought . yes , you read that right . the 2014 wine grape harvest was `` third in a string of great vintages this decade , '' the wine institute says . `` california vintners and growers across the state are grateful for another excellent vintage , despite an ongoing drought and earthquake that rocked south napa in late august just as crush was getting underway , '' the institute said in a statement last year . `` a mild winter and spring caused early bud break , although the overall length of the growing season was similar to past years . '' wine grapes use relatively low water , said institute spokeswoman gladys horiuchi . `` yes , drought years tend to produce terrific quality , '' she added . `` with the record high california wine grape harvests in 2012 , 2013 and 2014 , there is a good supply of california wine . '' that may be the only thing to toast about this drought .
<s> while republican gov. asa hutchinson was weighing an arkansas religious freedom bill , walmart voiced its opposition . </s> <s> walmart and other high-profile businesses are showing their support for gay and lesbian rights . </s> <s> their stance puts them in conflict with socially conservative republicans , traditionally seen as allies . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- as goes walmart , so goes the nation ? everyone from apple ceo tim cook to the head of the ncaa slammed religious freedom laws being considered in several states this week , warning that they would open the door to discrimination against gay and lesbian customers . but it was the opposition from walmart , the ubiquitous retailer that dots the american landscape , that perhaps resonated most deeply , providing the latest evidence of growing support for gay rights in the heartland . walmart 's staunch criticism of a religious freedom law in its home state of arkansas came after the company said in february it would boost pay for about 500,000 workers well above the federal minimum wage . taken together , the company is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot-button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals . and some prominent republicans are urging the party to take notice . former minnesota gov. tim pawlenty , who famously called on the gop to `` be the party of sam 's club , not just the country club , '' told cnn that walmart 's actions `` foreshadow where the republican party will need to move . '' `` the republican party will have to better stand for '' ideas on helping the middle class , said pawlenty , the head of the financial services roundtable , a washington lobbying group for the finance industry . the party 's leaders must be `` willing to put forward ideas that will help modest income workers , such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage , and prohibit discrimination in things such as jobs , housing , public accommodation against gays and lesbians . '' walmart , which employs more than 50,000 people in arkansas , emerged victorious on wednesday . hours after the company 's ceo , doug mcmillon , called on republican gov. asa hutchinson to veto the bill , the governor held a news conference and announced he would not sign the legislation unless its language was fixed . walmart 's opposition to the religious freedom law once again puts the company at odds with many in the republican party , which the company 's political action committee has tended to support . in 2004 , the walmart pac gave around $ 2 million to republicans versus less than $ 500,000 to democrats , according to data from the center for responsive politics . that gap has grown less pronounced in recent years . in 2014 , the pac spent about $ 1.3 million to support republicans and around $ 970,000 for democrats . it has been a gradual transformation for walmart . in 2011 , the company bulked up its nondiscrimination policies by adding protections for gender identity . two years later , the company announced that it would start offering health insurance benefits to same-sex partners of employees starting in 2014 . retail experts say walmart 's evolution on these issues over the years is partly a reflection of its diverse consumer base , as well as a recognition of the country 's increasingly progressive views of gay equality -lrb- support for same-sex marriage is at a new high of 59 % , according to a recent wall street journal/nbc news poll -rrb- . `` it 's easy for someone like a chick-fil-a to take a really polarizing position , '' said dwight hill , a partner at the retail consulting firm mcmillandoolittle . `` but in the world of the largest retailer in the world , that 's very different . '' hill added : same-sex marriage , `` while divisive , it 's becoming more common place here within the u.s. , and the businesses by definition have to follow the trend of their customer . '' the backlash over the religious freedom measures in indiana and arkansas this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community 's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality . after indiana gov. mike pence , a republican , signed his state 's religious freedom bill into law , ceos of companies big and small across the country threatened to pull out of the hoosier state . the resistance came from business leaders of all political persuasions , including bill oesterle , ceo of the business-rating website angie 's list and a one-time campaign manager for former indiana gov. mitch daniels . oesterle announced that his company would put plans on hold to expand its footprint in indianapolis in light of the state 's passage of the religious freedom act . nascar , scheduled to hold a race in indianapolis this summer , also spoke out against the indiana law . `` what we 're seeing over the past week is a tremendous amount of support from the business community who are standing up and are sending that equality is good for business and discrimination is bad for business , '' said jason rahlan , spokesman for the human rights campaign . the debate has reached presidential politics . national republicans are being forced to walk the fine line of protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination . likely gop presidential candidate jeb bush initially backed indiana 's religious freedom law and pence , but moderated his tone a few days later . the former florida governor said wednesday that indiana could have taken a `` better '' and `` more consensus-oriented approach . '' `` by the end of the week , indiana will be in the right place , '' bush said , a reference to pence 's promise this week to fix his state 's law in light of the widespread backlash . others in the gop field are digging in . sen. ted cruz of texas , the only officially declared republican presidential candidate , said wednesday that he had no interest in second-guessing pence and lashed out at the business community for opposing the law . `` i think it is unfortunate that large companies today are listening to the extreme left wing agenda that is driven by an aggressive gay marriage agenda , '' cruz said . meanwhile , former secretary of state hillary clinton , who previously served on walmart 's board of directors , called on hutchinson to veto the arkansas bill , saying it would `` permit unfair discrimination '' against the lgbt community . jay chesshir , ceo of the little rock regional chamber of commerce in arkansas , welcomed hutchinson 's pledge on wednesday to seek changes to his state 's bill . he said businesses are not afraid to wade into a politically controversial debate to ensure inclusive workplace policies . `` when it comes to culture and quality of life , businesses are extremely interested in engaging in debate simply because it impacts its more precious resource -- and that 's its people , '' chesshir said . `` therefore , when issues arise that have negative or positive impact on those things , then the business community will again speak and speak loudly .

<s> lz : indiana law pushing back lgbt rights , and other states ' anti-lgbt moves , bow to far right wing that gop candidates need for 2016 . </s> <s> cruz , huckabee , jindal , carson , walker are reviving culture wars , he says . equality for lgbt has not yet `` won '' in america . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- a year ago bloomberg published a story with the following headline : mike pence , a koch favorite , mulls 2016 run for president . the story ticked off items on pence 's conservative things-to-do list while also noting his close ties to the deep-pocketed koch brothers , as well as other right-wing lobbying groups . last august the indiana governor was in dallas for an americans for prosperity event ; the group is backed by the conservative koch brothers , and supported gov. pence 's tax-slashing budget . now , pence is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians . why would pence ignore the pleas of indiana 's chamber of commerce as well as the republican mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill ? because there 's a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was pence 's way of shoring up his street cred . it is also the reason why republican jeb bush , pence 's fellow white house hopeful , who is viewed as a little light in that category , was first to rush in to defend pence and the law . one lesson here : just because more than 70 % of the country now lives in states where same-sex marriage is legal does not mean 70 % of the country is happy about it . backlash aside , the fact is pence has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives . and while that may not be enough to get him over this political hump , the very public debate that now embroils him -- and arkansas gov. asa hutchinson , and likely 14 other states considering similar proposals this year -- is more than enough to drag the entire republican field farther to the right than the party had hoped . pence : ` was i expecting this kind of backlash ? heavens no . ' for there is no way a republican can get through the pending primary without denouncing lgbt rights , which unfortunately will turn numerous americans into single-issue voters . i foolishly hoped the issue of lgbt rights would be a bit player in the 2016 general election , overshadowed by foreign policy and the economy . instead it looks like it 's going to be dragged down to a replay of pat buchanan 's `` cultural war '' speech , during which he told the 1992 republican national convention : `` we stand with -lrb- george h.w. bush -rrb- against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women '' and later followed with `` there is a religious war going on in this country . it is a cultural war , as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the cold war itself . for this war is for the soul of america . '' progressives may enjoy watching pence 's temporary fall from grace , but his policy rhetoric has echoed that of 2016 hopeful sen. ted cruz of texas , who has indicated a federal ban on same-sex marriage is not off the gop table . and even if you think neither pence nor bush nor cruz will win the nomination , someone has to . in light of that , listen to conservative former arkansas gov. mike huckabee , a potential 2016 candidate describing conservatives ' discomfort with same-sex marriage : `` it 's like asking someone who 's jewish to start serving bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli . '' or louisiana gov. bobby jindal : `` i certainly will support ted cruz and others that are talking about making ... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage . '' or wisconsin gov. scott walker , who has a long history of fighting against same-sex marriage and civil unions . and ben carson said jail turns people gay , so there 's that . remember : pence did n't act alone . he only signed a bill that first passed muster with other elected officials . in fact , according to the american civil liberties union , `` the indiana rfra -lsb- religious freedom restoration act -rsb- is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate . numerous other bills specifically single out the lgbt community for unequal treatment . '' who supports , denounces indiana law ? gallup polls may suggest voters nationwide are more gay-friendly , but the trend on the state level tells a different story . perhaps we 're witnessing the final gasp of long-ago biases . or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated . former rep. barney frank of massachusetts , the first member of congress to marry someone of the same sex while in office , said he believes republicans want the supreme court to rule in favor of same-sex marriage to provide political cover in the gop primary . `` we 're winning , '' he told a crowd in chicago recently while promoting his latest book . i guess if you look at where the country was on lgbt issues 10 years ago , we definitely are . that 's assuming you are part of the `` we '' who believe lgbt people should have the same rights as their heterosexual/cisgender counterparts . but as the situation in indiana has shown , `` winning '' should not be mistaken for having `` won . '' for it is doubtful that a candidate will be able to avoid taking a position on the wave of so-called `` religious freedom '' bills snaking through red-state legislatures . or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it 's raised in a debate or at a campaign stop , especially with republicans controlling both the house and the senate . pence , and to a lesser extent , jeb bush , may be toxic now but america has a short attention span . more importantly , they are not alone . frank said when progressives get angry they march in the streets , and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls . if that holds true in 2016 , `` winning '' is going to feel very strange .

'' the boat capsized two more times before he was rescued , according to jordan . his father , frank jordan , told cnn 's jim sciutto that he was expecting his son to look different . `` he looked good . had n't lost too much weight . he was n't badly sunburned like i thought he probably would be , '' he said . lost at sea for 66 days . after his food and water ran out , it became an issue of survival . collecting fresh water was a nightmare for jordan . the weather would n't cooperate . records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the carolinas during the time he was missing . the precipitation came at night during harsh conditions . `` i had tried to collect -lrb- rain -rrb- water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat , '' jordan said . `` the waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad . `` finally the conditions were right . i filled up my water tank , which is 25 gallons . i filled up a bucket . '' then there was the issue of food . the fish were n't cooperating , but after a while jordan learned they were attracted to his laundry , which he would put out to sea for a rinse . the fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net , he said . jordan came ashore thursday evening . cnn affiliate wavy in norfolk , virginia , reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into sentara norfolk general hospital about 7:30 p.m. coast guard officials have said they have found no reason to doubt jordan 's incredible story . they noted that his father contacted them january 29 to report his son and his boat missing . frank jordan addressed the skepticism about his son 's appearance , saying the boat stayed afloat and upright most of the time . his son spent most of his days in the cabin , out of the sun . frank jordan said it was obvious when the jordans met at the hospital friday morning that his normally low-key and private son had been through an ordeal . `` i know he went through what he went through , '' frank jordan said . jordan is an unemployed truck driver who lived on his boat at a marina in conway . he had free rent and free food in the river , he said . but when it became difficult to catch dinner , he took off for the ocean in hopes he would land some bigger fish . frank jordan told cnn 's wolf blitzer on thursday that he had worried about his son , who is an inexperienced sailor , but he held hope because his son had a good boat . and he had the strength to make it . `` he 's got a very strong constitution and -lrb- is strong -rrb- not only physically , but spiritually , '' frank jordan said . `` and he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time , so i believe that sustained him a great deal . '' rescue swimmer kyle mccollum was the first to care for jordan on the flight back to land . `` you would expect sunburns , severe sunburn , blisters maybe ... a bunch of medical issues that could possibly be wrong with him , '' he said . `` but for him to be in his current state was pretty amazing . '' grenz was also surprised by jordan 's condition , physically and mentally . the rescued sailor knew almost exactly what day it was , remarkable for someone who had been on the water for more than 60 days . jordan was dehydrated and said he was hungry . `` we took him to a rescue boat , '' the container ship captain said . `` he was given water and pea soup to gain some power again . '' derriel morris , a neighbor at the bucksport plantation marina & rv resort called jordan a nice guy who loved his 47-year-old boat , named `` angel . '' morris said : `` it was immaculate , it was gorgeous , beautifully painted . i mean it looked like a brand new sailboat . '' morris told cnn affiliate wpde that one day in january he was going to the store and jordan asked him to bring back some coffee creamer . but when he returned to the marina , jordan had slipped away . `` there was no shore line , no hose ; it was like he was never there , '' morris told the station . after he disappeared others who also live there held a candlelight ceremony . the marina 's manager , jeff weeks , told wpde that jordan is expected to be back at buscksport next week . tales of people who cheated death after days , weeks adrift .

'' `` you 'll feel it when you see it , '' diesel said . `` there 's something emotional that happens to you , where you walk out of this movie and you appreciate everyone you love because you just never know when the last day is you 're gon na see them . '' there have been multiple tributes to walker leading up to the release . diesel revealed in an interview with the `` today '' show that he had named his newborn daughter after walker . social media has also been paying homage to the late actor . a week after walker 's death , about 5,000 people attended an outdoor memorial to him in los angeles . most had never met him . marcus coleman told cnn he spent almost $ 1,000 to truck in a banner from bakersfield for people to sign at the memorial . `` it 's like losing a friend or a really close family member ... even though he is an actor and we never really met face to face , '' coleman said . `` sitting there , bringing his movies into your house or watching on tv , it 's like getting to know somebody . it really , really hurts .

<s> richard klass : iran framework agreement on nukes is strong , but opponents will cast doubts on this and try to obscure its facts . </s> <s> he says the deal would cut uranium stockpile , centrifuges , implement rigorous inspections ; it should be judged on merits , not disinformation . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- the united states and its negotiating partners reached a very strong framework agreement with iran in lausanne , switzerland , on thursday that limits iran 's nuclear program in such a way as to effectively block it from building a nuclear weapon . expect pushback anyway , if the recent past is any harbinger . just last month , in an attempt to head off such an agreement , house speaker john boehner invited israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to preemptively blast it before congress , and 47 senators sent a letter to the iranian leadership warning them away from a deal . the debate that has already begun since the announcement of the new framework will likely result in more heat than light . it will not be helped by the gathering swirl of dubious assumptions and doubtful assertions . let us address some of these : . the most misleading assertion , despite universal rejection by experts , is that the negotiations ' objective at the outset was the total elimination of any nuclear program in iran . that is the position of netanyahu and his acolytes in the u.s. congress . but that is not and never was the objective . if it had been , there would have been no iranian team at the negotiating table . rather , the objective has always been to structure an agreement or series of agreements so that iran could not covertly develop a nuclear arsenal before the united states and its allies could respond . the new framework has exceeded expectations in achieving that goal . it would reduce iran 's low-enriched uranium stockpile , cut by two-thirds its number of installed centrifuges and implement a rigorous inspection regime . another dubious assumption of opponents is that the iranian nuclear program is a covert weapons program . despite sharp accusations by some in the united states and its allies , iran denies having such a program , and u.s. intelligence contends that iran has not yet made the decision to build a nuclear weapon . iran 's continued cooperation with international atomic energy agency inspections is further evidence on this point , and we 'll know even more about iran 's program in the coming months and years because of the deal . in fact , the inspections provisions that are part of this agreement are designed to protect against any covert action by the iranians . what 's more , the rhetoric of some members of congress has implied that the negotiations have been between only the united states and iran -lrb- i.e. , the 47 senators ' letter warning that a deal might be killed by congress or a future president -rrb- . this of course is not the case . the talks were between iran and the five permanent members of the u.n. security council -lrb- united states , united kingdom , france , china and russia -rrb- plus germany , dubbed the p5 +1 . while the united states has played a leading role in the effort , it negotiated the terms alongside its partners . if the agreement reached by the p5 +1 is rejected by congress , it could result in an unraveling of the sanctions on iran and threaten nato cohesion in other areas . another questionable assertion is that this agreement contains a sunset clause , after which iran will be free to do as it pleases . again , this is not the case . some of the restrictions on iran 's nuclear activities , such as uranium enrichment , will be eased or eliminated over time , as long as 15 years . but most importantly , the framework agreement includes iran 's ratification of the additional protocol , which allows iaea inspectors expanded access to nuclear sites both declared and nondeclared . this provision will be permanent . it does not sunset . thus , going forward , if iran decides to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels , monitors will be able to detect such a move in a matter of days and alert the u.n. security council . many in congress have said that the agreement should be a formal treaty requiring the senate to `` advise and consent . '' but the issue is not suited for a treaty . treaties impose equivalent obligations on all signatories . for example , the new start treaty limits russia and the united states to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads . but any agreement with iran will not be so balanced . the restrictions and obligations in the final framework agreement will be imposed almost exclusively on iran . the p5 +1 are obligated only to ease and eventually remove most but not all economic sanctions , which were imposed as leverage to gain this final deal . finally some insist that any agreement must address iranian missile programs , human rights violations or support for hamas or hezbollah . as important as these issues are , and they must indeed be addressed , they are unrelated to the most important aim of a nuclear deal : preventing a nuclear iran . to include them in the negotiations would be a poison pill . this agreement should be judged on its merits and on how it affects the security of our negotiating partners and allies , including israel . those judgments should be fact-based , not based on questionable assertions or dubious assumptions .

'' jose salvador alvarenga says his journey began in paredon viejo , a port on mexico 's pacific coast , in late 2012 . the exact date is up for debate -- he says he set off in december , locals say it was november . but what 's not in doubt is that , after he left , he disappeared . until january 2013 . that 's when alvarenga interacted with humans once again , thousands of miles away on a remote atoll in the marshall islands . castaway recounts how he survived over a year adrift in pacific . what was supposed to be a one-day trip , he says , turned into an arduous odyssey across the pacific ocean , one that saw him lose his fishing companion and tested his will and ability to survive . his nightmare began when winds blew the pair off course . then a storm hit causing their boat , which was about three people long and one wide , to lose its engine and use of its radio communication and gps systems . four weeks in , alvarenga said his partner -- 23-year-old ezequiel cordova , according to the boat 's owner -- died because he refused to eat raw birds . the days , weeks and months ran together after that . alvarenga says he drank rainwater and , when there was n't any available , his own urine . he ate sea turtles . then , after 13 or 14 months adrift , he and his small , heavily damaged boat arrived on the ebon atoll , about a 22-hour boat ride from the marshall islands capital of majuro . the atoll has one phone line , no internet service and a few residents , two of whom alvarenga spotted and shouted to after spending a night in the woods . the el salvador native told cnn that his faith in god helped him survive . `` i thought , ' i am going to get out , '' he said . `` get out , get out , get out .

'' at one point , a huge wave struck -- pushing his mast into the water and him as well . the 67-year-old used a rope to pull himself back in . but his boat could n't be rescued so easily , leaving him at the mercy of the current . a distress call went out , prompting a search that would cover 12,000 square miles . when a coast guard official told him the search was being called off december 1 , zakary ingraham responded , `` i do n't feel like he 's dead . i do n't feel it . '' he was right . twelve days after that first distress call , ron ingraham was picked up about 64 miles -lrb- 103 kilometers -rrb- south of honolulu `` weak , hungry and dehydrated '' and -- most importantly -- alive . the veteran fisherman headed back to shore only after getting assurances his damaged boat would come with him . in february 2012 , two friends asked 18-year-old adrian vasquez whether he wanted to tag along on an overnight fishing expedition . he said yes , and the three set off from the panama town of san carlos on a small boat , vasquez 's mother , nilsa de la cruz , recalled . things started out well , by all accounts . the three caught plenty of fish . then , their boat 's engine died without warning . and , with no tools and scant navigational experience , the trio did n't know what to do , according to vasquez 's mother . mother calls panama teen 's return ' a miracle ' vazquez ate raw fish and drank rainwater as currents swept his boat , the fifty cents , further and further from the coast and into the pacific ocean . somewhere along the way , his two companions died . it 's not clear exactly how , with ecuadorian rear . adm. freddy garcia calle saying vasquez threw their bodies into the sea `` because they had become badly decomposed . '' some 26 days after and nearly 600 miles away from where the journey began , fishermen spotted the tiny vessel north of the galapagos islands . the ecuadorian navy came in and picked up the teenage survivor , who 'd lost 20 pounds and showed `` severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition , '' according to calle . he returned home to loved ones eager to embrace him , but mindful of giving him time to process the ordeal . `` for us , this is an opportunity to get closer as a family , '' his mother said by phone , `` to be more understanding and loving . '' sometimes one does n't have to be in the ocean for weeks to have his or her life imperiled . sometimes people do n't have to set off by boat to have the sea challenge them to the end . for proof , look no further than hiromitsu shinkawa . 60-year-old man waves red flag to alert rescuers . he was at home on march 11 , 2011 , when a massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck 231 miles northeast of tokyo . a devastating tsunami followed , its 30-foot waves ravaging cities and towns and damaging several nuclear reactors . by the time it had run the course , nearly 16,000 people were dead . it 's a miracle shinkawa was n't one of them . shortly after the quake , he and his wife had gone to collect some belongings when the tsunami slammed their hometown of minamisoma . his home was one of the tens of thousands destroyed by the the huge , powerful tsunami wave . `` i was saved by holding onto the roof , '' the 60-year-old said , according to kyodo news agency . `` but my wife was swept away .

'' iran had been in the running to host the 2019 edition of soccer 's asian cup , but the tournament was awarded to the united arab emirates . the ban on women attending matches was widely seen as a major impediment to iran 's chances of securing the event . the ban came under the spotlight at the asian cup in australia earlier this year , when thousands of female iranian fans watched their soccer team without restriction . during the match against iraq , activists called for the ban to end and unfurled a banner showing the face of ghoncheh ghavami , a british-iranian woman detained in iran last year while trying to watch a volleyball match . iranian officials have denied that ghavami was arrested for attending the volleyball game , saying she was taken into custody for `` anti-iran activities .

'' netanyahu 's most recent argument against the iran nuclear deal was similar to the one he 'd made in a march trip to washington , when he addressed a joint session of congress -- fueling a republican push to have the deal sent to congress before it 's implemented . `` it does not roll back iran 's nuclear program . it keeps a vast nuclear infrastructure in place . not a single centrifuge is destroyed . not a single nuclear facility is shut down , including the underground facilities that they built illicitly . thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning , enriching uranium , '' netanyahu said sunday . `` that 's a very bad deal . '' netanyahu said iran is a country of `` congenital cheating '' and that it ca n't be trusted to abide by the terms of the deal , which lasts 10 years with some provisions extending well beyond that . he said his opposition has little to do with his frosty relationship with obama . `` i think that we can have a legitimate difference of opinion on this , because i think iran has shown to be completely distrustful , '' netanyahu said . democratic sen. dianne feinstein of california , meanwhile , said she wishes netanyahu `` would contain himself . '' the top-ranking democrat on the senate intelligence committee said negotiators working on the deal -- from iran and the united states , as well as russia , china , britain , france and germany -- are `` on the cusp of something that can be workable . '' `` it 's a framework . it has to be wrapped into a final agreement . there still can be some changes , '' feinstein said . `` but i do n't think it 's helpful for israel to come out and oppose this one opportunity to change a major dynamic -- which is downhill , a downhill dynamic in this part of the world . '' energy secretary ernest moniz defended the deal in an appearance on cbs ' `` face the nation '' on sunday , saying it would extend from two months to one year the `` breakout '' time period -- the length of time it would take iran to build a nuclear bomb . he said it also allows for the `` almost instantaneous recognition of any attempt to evade the deal . '' `` we have blocked all of these pathways to a bomb , '' he said . sen. lindsey graham , r-south carolina , said on `` face the nation '' that the best option for the united states is to keep current sanctions in place for two more years and then have a `` new crack at it with a new president that does n't have the baggage of obama . '' and he said the alternatives to obama on both sides -- with the exception of sen. rand paul of kentucky , who 's called for a less active u.s. role overseas -- would likely strike a better deal . `` hillary clinton would do better . i think everybody on our side , except , maybe , rand paul , could do better , '' graham said .

<s> easter is a key event in the christian faith , but where did the easter bunny come from ? </s> <s> why is the date different every year , and what does it have to do with the moon ? </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- easter is a cornerstone event in the christian faith , but it 's surrounded by interesting quirks . it celebrates the completion of christ 's mission of salvation in the crucifixion and resurrection . by dying on good friday , christ atoned for the sins of others ; by rising from the grave on sunday , christ conquered death . simple enough and reason for christians to celebrate . but , like christmas with its tree , ornaments and santa claus , easter has picked up its peripheral trappings -- the bunny and colorful eggs . unlike christmas , it does n't fall on the same day every year but shifts around in spring depending upon cosmic events . and that blood moon we just had -- is it pure coincidence that it fell around easter ? -lrb- no . -rrb- . here 's a journey from the vatican to the holy land , around the moon and the earth 's tilting axis , to germany and the united states to try to explain the complex holiday called easter . and you 'll learn to how to color easter eggs with kool-aid . let 's start at the vatican . at the vatican , holy week began with palm sunday last week and culminated in easter sunday mass with multiple celebrations in between to mark the final week of christ 's mortal life . jesus rode on the back of a donkey into jerusalem on palm sunday where crowds celebrated him as the messiah and laid down palm branches in his path . but the crowd and the romans turned on him in the course of the week , according to the bible , leading to his crucifixion and resurrection . rain sprinkled down on worshipers standing under a sea of umbrellas as they gathered in a gray st. peter 's square on sunday to partake in the outdoor services held by pope francis . afterward , the pontiff took a moment to tell the world to do right those in need in his urbi et orbi address . francis lamented the suffering of people in many of the conflicts around the globe . from nigeria to south sudan , iraq to ukraine , he expressed hope that violence would end . francis also does n't put on airs . this week he washed the feet of believers , repeating the biblical account of a woman , a sinner , washing jesus ' feet and anointing them with oil . let 's move on to old jerusalem , the birthplace of easter . the church of the holy sepulcher in old jerusalem unifies the spot where christ was crucified -- calvary -- with his tomb , or sepulcher . on sunday , catholics and armenian christians celebrated the resurrection there . in the morning , the latin patriarch , the archbishop of jerusalem , entered the basilica . then mass was held followed by a procession . but a large group of indigenous christians did n't join them . it 's not quite easter yet in the holy land for eastern orthodox christians . they 'll be celebrating a week from now , because they determine easter 's date by a different calendar than western christians -- the julian calendar . which brings us to the question of how astronomy is used to determine the date of easter sunday . a blood moon appeared in the sky early saturday , right between good friday and easter sunday and during passover . just a coincidence ? not completely , because the dates for both passover -- the jewish holiday celebrating the deliverance from slavery in egypt -- and easter are determined by moon phases , according to timeanddate.com . easter 's timing is related to passover , because jesus was crucified around then , according to the bible . many jewish holidays , including passover , fall on full moon , which is also a prerequisite for a lunar eclipse , the event that turns the moon a blood red color . since the timing of moon phases does n't jibe with earth 's orbit -- which is how we determine the length of a year now -- passover 's exact date moves around -- and so does easter 's . when christian bishops first convened at the council of nicaea in the year 325 , they made a rule to determine the date of easter , so as to fairly reliably pin it to passover : . it would fall on the first sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox . that 's the day in march when earth 's axis reaches a midpoint between winter and summer and the day and night are of equal length . but ... if the full moon fell on sunday , easter would be pushed down a week . confusing ? it got worse . when the west moved from the julian calendar to the gregorian calendar , orthodox christians stayed put , resulting in -- usually -- two separate dates for easter . in 1997 , the world council of churches pushed for a unified method of determining a date based on astronomical occurrences . it did n't catch on . but some odd easter trappings that popped up after the middle ages very much have -- the eggs and the bunny . the bunny is an egg-laying pagan that worships the moon . that 's one notion of its origins , but probably not the actual one . german immigrants appear to have brought it to north america in the 1700s . german historians are not clear on its beginnings , but the first known mention of the bunny and the eggs in writing was in 1682 . professor of medicine georg franck von frankenau described in his paper `` de ovis paschalibus , '' or `` on easter eggs , '' a custom in the alsace region involving a bunny and eggs , according to german public television . some also credit the region with inadvertently inventing the christmas tree . but von frankenau left out any explanation of how the tradition arose , leading to a number of theories in germany . one common idea : during lent , people had to abstain from eating eggs , but hens kept on laying them , so farmers boiled and preserved them . by the time easter rolled around , they were practically swimming in them . they had to figure out something to do with them when the holiday hit . play hide and seek with them ; color them ; give them as gifts . parents may have invented the bunny as a playful explanation for children on where the easter eggs came from . if you 're coloring eggs this year , here 's an interesting tip . instead of stinking up your place with the smell of vinegar , use kool-aid , youtube science geek grant thompson suggests . and it appears to work . just use a whole packet in a small glass of hot water and gently lay the eggs in . they turn out as bright as they would in any other food dye . but be careful , it stains everything else , like clothes and upholstery , thompson warns . that 's why your tongue changes colors when you drink it . happy easter ! happy passover !

<s> going online has become the path of least resistance if you want to make yourself heard . </s> <s> but where there is the restrictive rule of law , journalists are vulnerable to the anger of officialdom . </s> <s> from china to malaysia , journalists and bloggers have been jailed -- even killed . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- just as mimeograph machines and photocopiers were in their day , online activity -- blogs , youtube channels , even social media platforms like facebook and twitter -- have fully emerged as the alternative to traditional mainstream media . it is not just the low cost of posting online that attracts dissidence , though that in itself is liberating . it is the lack of access to traditional print and broadcast media in authoritarian countries that is really the driving force leading disaffected voices to post online . it is not unique to asia , but it might seem more pronounced if you live there . going online has become the path of least resistance if you want to make yourself heard . but it still brings resistance , some of it legal , some of it deadly . let 's look at the legal angle first . amos yee , the teenage video blogger who was arrested and held pending bail sunday in singapore , drew international attention for his anti-lee kuan yew harangue . but jailing critics is not usually the government 's first choice in singapore . it is part of lee kuan yew 's legacy that the government 's use of the courts to bring libel and defamation cases , usually carrying heavy financial penalties , is the preferred method of silencing discomfiting online voices . his father has reportedly apologized for his son 's behavior , but the younger yee could face up to three years in jail . yee is not unique . another dissident blogger in singapore , roy ngerng , continues to suffer financial and legal pressure , including the loss of his job , because of a blog post that allegedly accused the city-state 's prime minister , lee hsien loong , of corruption . ngerng 's concern is with the lack of transparency in the management of the central provident fund , the government 's compulsory pension program . yee and ngerng are two of many . the committee to protect journalists ' file on singapore going back to 2000 has a long string of similar cases , some against politicians , others against citizens simply frustrated with their government . but it is not just singapore where internet activity comes under fire : on monday in malaysia , with much less of the international attention heaped on amos yee , five editors and executives from the malaysian insider were arrested over the site 's march 25 report claiming that a senior council of royal rulers and state governors , known as the conference of rulers , had rejected a proposal to amend federal law to allow for the introduction of hudud , or punishments meted out under islamic law . in deeply muslim malaysia , questions of islamic faith are a third-rail issue , as is revealing government decisions before they are announced . by far the biggest jailer of journalists in the world is china , where a majority of the 44 people behind bars at the end of 2014 were bloggers , most of them uighur or tibetan activists who straddle the line between journalism and activism . but in second place in asia is vietnam , where cpj 's most recent prison census showed vietnam holding 16 reporters behind bars as of december 1 . add one more in late december , nguyen dinh ngoc , a prominent blogger who was arrested for `` law-violating '' after police searched his home in southern ho chi minh city on december 27 , and two more in january , nguyen quang lap and hong le tho , arrested on anti-state charges of `` abusing democratic freedoms '' and you can see the pattern . because the print and broadcast media are so totally government controlled , mainstream journalists seldom go to jail any more in vietnam . only two investigative print reporters remain behind bars in vietnam , their cases dating back to 2012 and 2013 . both were accused of accepting bribes for dialing back critical news coverage . the list could go on , but the reality is that , as cpj wrote in 2013 , across asia `` governments have curtailed internet freedoms through increasingly restrictive practices , including prohibitive laws , heightened surveillance and censorship , and threats of imprisonment on various national security-related offenses . '' that is still the policy path being followed by most countries in asia , and it does not look like it will be changing any time soon . jailing journalists is one thing , but watching them being killed and doing little or nothing about it is another . since 1992 , 11 % of journalists killed have died for their work online . because our 1992 start date really precedes the full advent of the internet , that proportion can be expected to grow . while most bloggers have not been the targets of murderers , bangladesh has recently become the exception . on monday , washiqur rahman babu was the second blogger to be hacked to death in public in bangladesh in the past five weeks . blogger avijit roy and his wife , rafida ahmed bonna , were attacked by assailants wielding sharp weapons while the couple was visiting dhaka . roy , a u.s. citizen of bangladeshi origin , was killed and his wife was critically injured . both rahman and roy had written critically on islamic matters . the blogger death toll gets higher in bangladesh if you go back a year or two , and religious beliefs are always involved , and the killings almost always carried out with near perfect impunity . in january 2013 , blogger asif mohiuddin , who wrote critical commentary on religion , islamist groups , free speech , and human rights , barely survived after he was stabbed by islamists . in february 2013 , blogger ahmed rajib haider , who had written about islamic fundamentalism and islamist groups , was hacked to death by members of an islamist militant group , according to police investigations . later in 2013 , islamist groups called for the execution of bloggers they said had committed blasphemy . while arrests were made after those murders , there have been no convictions . the bottom line : online journalists , operating outside the restraints of mainstream media , have become the most vulnerable targets for governments and independent actors . where there is the restrictive rule of law , journalists are vulnerable to the anger of officialdom . where the rule of law is weak , they are vulnerable to the attacks of killers who seldom , if ever , answer to the rule of law .

<s> in response to lawsuit , ncaa says it does n't control quality of education for student-athletes . </s> <s> but its website emphasizes importance of education , `` opportunities to learn '' </s> <s> lawsuit claims students did n't get an education because of academic fraud at unc . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- after years of making the case that the education of athletes is paramount , the ncaa now says it has no legal responsibility to make sure education is actually delivered . on its website , the ncaa prominently states , `` it 's our commitment -- and our responsibility -- to give young people opportunities to learn , play and succeed . '' and later , it says that `` in the collegiate model of sports , the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first , athletes second . '' but the ncaa is taking a very different position in response to a lawsuit filed by former university of north carolina athletes . the lawsuit claimed the students did n't get an education because they were caught up in the largest known academic fraud scandal in ncaa history . in its response , the ncaa says it has no legal responsibility `` to ensure the academic integrity of the courses offered to student-athletes at its member institutions . '' even with pages of online information about academic standards , and even though the ncaa has established a system of academic eligibility and accountability that it boasts of regularly , ncaa attorneys wrote in this court filing that `` the ncaa did not assume a duty to ensure the quality of the education of student-athletes , '' and `` the ncaa does not have ` direct , day-to-day , operational control ' '' over member institutions like unc . `` it 's nonsense . it 's double talk , '' said gerald gurney , a former athletic-academic director who is now president of the drake group for academic integrity in collegiate sport . `` if you look at their basic core principles , it 's all about academics , the experience , the integration of academics , and the education of the student is paramount , '' gurney said . `` they seem to talk out of both sides of their mouths . '' the ncaa referred calls for comment to an online statement , which read in part : . the ncaa believes that the lawsuit misunderstands the ncaa 's role with respect to its member schools and ignores the myriad steps the ncaa has taken to assist student-athletes in being equipped to excel both in the classroom and on the playing field . `` this case is troubling for a number of reasons , not the least of which is that the law does not and has never required the ncaa to ensure that every student-athlete is actually taking full advantage of the academic and athletic opportunities provided to them , '' said donald remy , ncaa chief legal officer . in its response to the lawsuit , it also likened its role to that of the american bar association or american medical association , and said that those entities are not sued every time a lawyer or doctor acts inappropriately . the scandal at unc involved thousands of athletes who , over 18 years , were funneled into classes that never met , where advisers fudged grades and accepted plagiarism so that athletes who were falling behind in class could remain eligible to play sports . mary willingham , the unc whistleblower turned ncaa critic , has for years said that athletes across the country are accepted to colleges even though they 're academically underprepared and then pushed into classes where little work is required . the system of eligibility that the ncaa brags about , she says , is a sham . `` why do we go through the trouble of compliance if we ca n't legitimize that the courses are real and the education is real anyway ? it makes no sense , '' said willingham , who recently wrote a book about the unc scandal called `` cheated . '' `` if they ca n't legitimize that the academics are real and take no responsibility for that , then why certify students semester after semester to play ? it 's lost its meaning for me . '' the ncaa 's claim that it 's hands-off when it comes to athletics seems to be a direct contradiction of what the organization has been repeating for years , not just in the rhetoric on its website , but in speeches by its president , mark emmert , and in court defending itself from numerous lawsuits over paying athletes . for example , before it lost a case filed by former ucla player ed o'bannon , suing for the right of athletes to make money off their images and likenesses , the ncaa stood on the pillar of amateurism , insisting that college athletes are paid with an education . that 's the defense the ncaa is now using in another class action filed by big-time sports attorney jeffrey kessler , seeking to make college sports a free market where athletes are paid salaries based on their value . in response , the ncaa said that what sets college sports apart from pros is education : consistent with `` its commitment to amateurism , member institutions conduct their athletics programs for students who choose to participate in intercollegiate athletics as a part of their educational experience and in accordance with ncaa bylaws . '' attorney michael hausfeld , who represented both o'bannon and now the unc athletes , said this : . `` this startling inconsistency is unfortunately all too symptomatic of the ncaa 's shifting rhetoric and faltering commitment to its college athletes . ncaa president mark emmert has repeatedly proposed that ` what we live for is the education of our athletes , ' but the ncaa 's record tells a far different story . '' but rick burton , professor of sport management at syracuse university , said it 's not realistic to think that the ncaa would regulate every professor and every course an athlete might take at each university across the country . `` i understand , i think , where the ncaa is coming from . we would not let the ncaa come in and tell us how to run our chemistry department at syracuse university , '' he said . `` it sounds like someone is trying to say the ncaa should have been supervising that department at the university of north carolina , and there 's no logic to that , '' he said . `` the people who are saying the ncaa should be held accountable for academics at every school are just looking for an opportunity to throw rocks at the ncaa . '' unc , which was also sued , has admitted to the fraud , but also asked for a judge to throw out the case , saying the athletes waited too long -- seven years -- to sue and the `` educational malpractice '' theory does n't apply . unc claims it is protected by state law . this is reminiscent of another ncaa reversal . the ncaa , which was founded a century ago to protect athletes from `` dangerous and exploitive athletic practices , '' now says it does not enforce health and safety rules . in fact , in response to a lawsuit filed by the family of a player who died in 2011 , the ncaa wrote : `` the ncaa denies that it has a legal duty to protect student-athletes . '' a cnn investigation found that the ncaa has failed to open investigations in several cases where safety rules allegedly were broken . it has also fallen behind in imposing rules for concussions -- far behind even the nfl . ramogi huma , president of the national college players association , and a leading thorn in the ncaa 's side for decades , said this latest backpedaling from the ncaa leaves him wondering why the organization exists at all . `` there 's nothing left the ncaa can claim it does that is beneficial to college athletes or society . one has to wonder what does the ncaa do if it does n't protect players ? if it does n't play a role in the education of college athletics ? it begs the question of why does the ncaa exist -- and why does it have a tax exemption .

<s> the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- begins again after a two-year shutdown . </s> <s> the restart was delayed in march . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- the world 's biggest and most powerful physics experiment is taking place as you read this . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , a particle accelerator and the largest machine in the world , is ready for action following a two-year shutdown . after problems that delayed the restart in march , scientists at the european organization for nuclear research -lrb- cern -rrb- completed final tests , enabling the first beams to start circulating sunday inside the lhc 's 17 mile -lrb- 27 km -rrb- ring . `` operating accelerators for the benefit of the physics community is what cern 's here for , '' cern director-general rolf heuer said on the organization 's website . `` today , cern 's heart beats once more to the rhythm of the lhc . '' the lhc generates up to 600 million particles per second , with a beam circulating for 10 hours , traveling more than 6 billion miles -lrb- more than 10 billion kilometers -rrb- -- the distance from earth to neptune and back again . at near light-speed , a proton in the lhc makes 11,245 circuits per second . it took thousands of scientists , engineers and technicians decades to devise and build the particle accelerator , housed in a tunnel between lake geneva and the jura mountain range . the purpose of the lengthy project is to recreate the conditions that existed moments after the `` big bang '' -- the scientific theory said to explain the creation of the universe . by replicating the energy density and temperature , scientists hope to uncover how the universe evolved . our current , limited , knowledge is based on what 's called the standard model of particle physics . `` but we know that this model is not complete , '' dr. mike lamont , operations group leader at the lhc , told cnn in march . the burning questions that remain include the origin of mass and why some particles are very heavy , while others have no mass at all ; a unified description of all the fundamental forces such as gravity ; and uncovering dark matter and dark energy , since visible matter accounts for only 4 percent of the universe . the lhc could also question the idea that the universe is only made of matter , despite the theory that antimatter must have been produced in the same amounts at the time of the big bang . cern says the energies achievable by the lhc have only ever been found in nature . the machine alone costs approximately three billion euros -lrb- about $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , paid for by member countries of cern and contributions by non-member nations . the organization also asserts that its guidelines for the protection of the environment and personnel comply with standards set by swiss and french laws and a european council directive . scientists and physics enthusiasts will be waiting with bated breath as the lhc ventures into the great unknown . `` after two years of effort , the lhc is in great shape , '' said cern director for accelerators and technology , frédérick bordry . `` but the most important step is still to come when we increase the energy of the beams to new record levels .

<s> bombing of targets in central sanaa smashes residents ' windows and doors . </s> <s> hundreds killed in less than two weeks ; humanitarian situation desperate , agencies say . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- residents of central sanaa , the yemeni capital , have learned the hard way that key strategic bombing targets are located in their neighborhoods : detonating ordnance has been shattering their windows and doors . and fighting has killed hundreds of people in less than two weeks . the saudi-led coalition smashed parts of yemen 's defense ministry central command in the capital over the weekend , senior yemeni officials said . under the rain of coalition bombs , the houthis , who are shiites in a majority sunni country , still control sanaa . but the airstrikes have hurt them and destroyed a lot of infrastructure . the electricity has gone out on 16 million yemenis living in houthi-held areas , the yemeni officials said . many fear they will lose access to clean water as well . yemen 's deposed president abdu rabu mansour hadi heaped scorn on top of the airstrikes . he fired his former army chief of staff , hussein khairan , on sunday . the firing had no practical effect , since khairan had switched sides weeks ago and is the houthi rebels ' acting defense minister . hadi is holed up in saudi arabia , which is working to defeat his enemies and reinstall him . fighting has ended dozens of lives each day . on monday , more than 50 people died in the port city of aden alone , where houthis and their allies are battling troops loyal to hadi on the ground , agence france-press reported . since the bombing campaign and intense fighting began just over a week ago , some 600 people are estimated to have been killed . many more have been wounded , and tens of thousands have fled the country . the international committee of the red cross has cried out for a humanitarian ceasefire to let aid in . `` otherwise , put starkly , many more people will die . for the wounded , their chances of survival depend on action within hours , not days , '' said robert mardini , the icrc 's head of operations in the near and middle east . `` medical supplies need to be here yesterday , '' said icrc spokeswoman marie-claire feghali from sanaa . `` we need to save the lives that can be saved . '' saudi arabia signed off on letting the icrc into yemen via two aircraft -- one with medical supplies , the other with workers . but flying in will be hard , since most airlines have canceled their flights , and airstrikes have taken out many airfields . on monday , the flight loaded with 48 tons of medical supplies was grounded in djibouti , feghali said . the icrc is hoping to fly out in a day or two . following the icrc 's call , on saturday the u.n. security council discussed the humanitarian situation at russia 's behest . moscow submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes by the nine-country regional coalition . the meeting adjourned with no decision announced . one diplomat said the draft was missing key elements . it did n't call for the houthis to stop fighting or for political talks between the belligerents , the diplomat told cnn on condition of anonymity . yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since houthi rebels -- who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority sunni country -- forced hadi from power . the houthis put hadi under house arrest when they overtook sanaa in january . but hadi escaped in february , fled to aden and declared himself to still be president . houthis and their allies , including those loyal to hadi 's predecessor , then fought hadi 's forces in the aden area . hadi fled aden in late march , ultimately for saudi arabia , when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city . the conflict prompted saudi arabia , a predominately sunni nation and yemen 's northern neighbor , and other arab nations to intervene with force . the houthis are allied with iran , saudi arabia 's bitter rival across the persian gulf , and riyadh does not want an proxy of iran in power on its border . complicating matters in yemen is the fact that al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -- not the houthis or the forces loyal to hadi -- holds sway in the country 's east . aqap is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization . it has taken advantage of the chaos to overrun one city and break prisoners out of jail . hadi 's government had cooperated with the united states to fight aqap , but with the houthi takeover , that arrangement has evaporated , and the terror group operates generally unchecked .

<s> a group of chicago pastors takes on city hall over its permits for new churches and loses . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- the united states has seemingly erupted this week about what it means to live your religion , especially in indiana , where its new religious freedom restoration act faces a firestorm from critics who say it uses faith as a pretext to discriminate against gay people . such state laws have been growing ever since the u.s. religious freedom restoration act became law in 1993 , designed to prohibit the federal government from `` substantially burdening '' a person 's exercise of religion . so far , 20 states have some version of the religious liberty law , and the legal controversies have grown , too . nonetheless , claims under those state rfras are `` exceedingly rare , '' and victories involved mostly religious minorities , not christian denominations , experts say . `` there is reason to doubt whether these state-level religious liberty provisions truly provide meaningful protections for religious believers , '' wrote wayne state university law professor christopher lund in a 2010 analysis , when there were only 16 states with such laws . here are some of the more interesting cases arising from the federal and state laws , touching upon an array of religious matters from a knife carried by an irs accountant to a tea from the amazon : . he was a native american with eagle feathers at a religious gathering of tribes . but not in the eyes of the feds . in 2006 , robert soto and michael russell attended an american indian powwow while in possession of eagle feathers , in violation of the federal eagle protection act , which outlaws the killing of bald and golden eagles and even picking their feathers off the ground . soto , a lipan apache , asserted he was participating in an indian religious ceremony . the feathers are sacred to native americans . but a federal fish and wildlife service agent found his tribe was n't federally recognized , and soto surrendered his feathers . russell , who is married to soto 's sister , is n't american indian and agreed to pay a fine , according to court papers and the america bar association journal . soto , however , petitioned the federal interior department to return his feathers . the feds said no , because he was n't from a recognized tribe . soto and russell sued the federal government , but a federal district court ruled in favor of the government , rejecting the two men 's first amendment assertions and their claims under the federal religious freedom restoration act , the same 1993 statute that indiana legislators used in developing their new state law . but last august , the 5th u.s. circuit court of appeals reversed the trial court 's decision and sent the case back to that court after finding the government 's action would violate the federal rfra . on march 10 , the federal government returned the eagle feathers to soto . but the legal war is n't over . the federal government still maintains it can criminally prosecute soto and his congregants , so soto is seeking a preliminary injunction , claiming the feds are violating the federal rfra , said luke goodrich , soto 's attorney who 's with the becket fund for religious liberty . a tea used by a brazilian faith is to them like wine used by catholics at communion , but u.s. agents considered the brew an illegal drug . the religious organization o centro espirita beneficiente uniao do vegetal uses a sacramental tea called hoasca , made from two plants native to the amazon that contains dimethyltryptamine , a hallucinogen , in violation of the controlled substances act . the religion is a christian spiritist faith that originated in brazil and includes amazonian and indigenous spiritual traditions . about 140 members of the church live in the united states and use the tea in a sacred communion . in may 1999 , u.s. customs agents entered the church headquarters in santa fe , new mexico , and seized all of its hoasca . the church became alarmed and cited how the federal government allows an exception for american indians to use another illegal drug , peyote , in their religious ceremonies . in fact , the federal rfra was designed partly to protect the native americans ' use of peyote , said cnn legal analyst jeffrey toobin . `` they were a legitimate religion , and this was a legitimate ritual of the religion , and congress wanted to make sure it was protected , '' toobin said of peyote and the 1993 law . the uniao do vegetal , which means `` the union of the plants , '' cited that federal law in suing the federal government . `` the government has never explained why it has accommodated the native american church 's use of peyote -lrb- which contains mescaline , also a controlled substance -rrb- but can not accommodate the udv 's use of hoasca , '' the church said in a statement . the u.s. supreme court ruled in the church 's favor , saying the federal government failed to show a compelling interest to ban the substance for religious use . `` the peyote exception also fatally undermines the government 's broader contention that the controlled substances act establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under rfra , '' the court ruling said . bruce rich , an orthodox jewish prisoner in florida , wanted kosher meals , but the warden said no . so rich sued the state prison system in 2010 , saying its denial of a kosher menu violated the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of 2000 , a landmark civil law rights law for inmates whose predecessor was the federal religious freedom law . rich , 66 , is serving a life sentence for murdering his parents , in their 70s , in 1995 allegedly to inherit their home . the prison system argued the meals were costly and would lead to security concerns , namely `` retaliation against the kosher inmates '' if other inmates believed the higher costs of kosher meals impacted the quality of their food , court papers said . at least 35 other states and the federal government , however , provided kosher diets to inmates . after losing before a magistrate , rich won an appeal before the 11th circuit court , which cited `` the defendant 's meager efforts to explain why florida 's prisons are so different from the penal institutions that now provide kosher meals such that the plans adopted by those other institutions would not work in florida . '' recently baptized in the sikh faith , kawal tagore went to her job with the irs in houston in 2005 carrying a new religious item : a 9-inch kirpan , a small ceremonial sword that resembles a knife but has an edge that is blunted or curved . tagore needed to carry the kirpan at all times as a mandatory article of faith . but the federal government banned her from the building , citing the kirpan as a `` dangerous weapon '' with a more than 3-inch blade , and she was later fired from her accounting job because she refused to keep the kirpan out of the workplace . tagore sued the government under the federal law . tagore cited how the government allowed the public to enter the federal building with more threatening objects : real 2.5-inch blade knives and metal canes , said her attorneys with the newar law firm and the becket fund . also , federal employees inside the building were allowed to use box cutters and cake knives . in november , the federal government agreed to settle the case shortly after the start of tagore 's trial . the settlement included no admission of wrongdoing , the christian science monitor reported . tagore 's attorneys described the settlement as `` a groundbreaking policy allowing sikhs and other religious minorities to wear religious symbols and attire in federal buildings , '' they said in a statement . invoking a religious freedom law and related statutes does n't always equate to victory . in chicago , an association of 40 churches called the civil liberties for urban believers found it too onerous to erect houses of worship in business and commercial zones . the ministers needed a special use permit , but such permits were often thwarted by aldermen or it was too bureaucratic and costly to obtain one , the church leaders claimed . in fact , it was easier to get a club , lodge or community center approved . so the pastors sued the city of chicago in 2000 , alleging that its zoning laws violated the illinois religious freedom statute , the federal religious land use and institutionalized persons act and the u.s. constitution . but in 2003 , the 7th circuit court of appeals upheld a lower court decision and rejected the church group 's claims , finding no substantial burden on the churches , which also failed to establish their rluipa claim . defeated , church leaders were angry . `` the forty -lrb- 40 -rrb- churches in c.l.u.b. and certainly people of all faiths throughout chicago are outraged by the majority opinion which neuters the religious land use and institutionalized persons act passed unanimously by congress in 2000 , '' apostle theodore wilkinson , the group 's chairman , said in a statement . `` also alarming is the court 's conclusion that chicago 's religious assemblies have no free speech protection from zoning laws . the majority opinion would apparently extend free speech protection to religious assemblies only if they allowed live nude dancing , '' he said . at the same time , the city of chicago revised its zoning ordinance to avoid `` the threat of heightened scrutiny under rluipa , '' according to a league of california cities report in 2002 . cnn 's alexandra meeks contributed to this report .
<s> terrorist group al-shabaab has attacked a kenyan college , killing and taking hostages . </s> <s> it is a clear indicator the security situation in east africa is deteriorating , says stefan wolff . </s> <s> more than military action aloe is needed to combat terrorism in the region , he says . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- the terrorist group al-shabaab has claimed an attack on garissa university college in eastern kenya , in which many people have been killed and still more taken hostage . the attack is another step in the ongoing escalation of the terrorist group 's activities , and a clear indicator that the security situation in east africa is deteriorating fast . somalia-based al-shabaab has been behind a string of recent attacks in kenya , the most well-known of them being the massacre at the westgate shopping centre in nairobi in 2013 . cross-border raids into kenya by the group , however , date back to 2011 . al-shabaab incursions triggered a military response by the government in nairobi , which sent troops to somalia as part of an african union mission in support of somalia 's internationally recognized government that had been under pressure from al-shabaab and other militants for several years . al-shabaab is predominantly driven by the same radical interpretation of the koran as al-qaeda and isis -lrb- also known as islamic state -rrb- , but also employs more opportunistic approaches to shoring up local support . its origins lie in al-ittihad al-islami -lrb- unity of islam -rrb- , one of several militant factions that emerged in the wake of the fall of siad barre in 1991 . these disparate groups fought each other and a u.n. peacekeeping mission in the somali civil war that led to the complete collapse of the country , from which it has yet to recover almost quarter of a century later . al-shabaab -lrb- literally `` the youth '' -rrb- split from unity of islam in 2003 and merged with another radical islamist group , the so-called islamic courts union . as their alliance obtained control of somalia 's capital mogadishu in 2006 , ethiopia , the only majority christian country in the region , took military action against the group . the offensive weakened al-shabaab and pushed it back into the rural areas of central and southern somalia , but it failed to defeat it . to the contrary , ethiopia 's invasion and occupation of parts of somalia -- although invited by the somali government and backed by the african union -- enabled al-shabaab to partially re-invent itself as both an islamist and nationalist force opposing a foreign `` christian '' invasion . initially , the group primarily attacked ethiopian forces , but soon began to `` expand '' its activities against the somali government as well . the first attack outside somalia was an attack in the ugandan capital of kampala in 2010 . soon after this , cross-border raids in kenya began , predominantly targeting christians there . increasing its links with al-qaeda , al-shabaab declared its full allegiance in 2012 -- and it is not clear whether it will switch allegiances to isis . much will depend on how the relationships between al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , a long-time ally of al-shabaab based in yemen , and isis develop . the key point is that al-shabaab 's attack in garissa is part of a broader regional context of instability fueled by a huge number of factors . it must not be interpreted simply as another act of garden-variety fundamentalist terrorism . clearly , the presence and activities of terrorist groups in the region is a major concern , and it is undoubtedly driven by radical and exclusivist interpretations of islam . but the entire region also suffers from a range of other problems : from economic development challenges to environmental degradation ; from organized crime to inter-tribal and inter-communal violence ; from corruption to serious deficits in human rights and good governance . these entrenched inequalities help al-shabaab appeal to a wide variety of potential recruits , who may sympathize with and actively support the group for any number of reasons . attacking a university in northern kenya and separating christian from muslim students epitomizes the way al-shabaab advances itself by exploiting religious , tribal and nationalist identities . ultimately , though , this all comes down to a struggle for control -- over people , over territory , and over resources . as long as the majority of people in the region remain excluded from any meaningful political , economic , and social participation in their societies -- which are dominated by primarily self-interested elites that put their own advance before that of their communities -- human lives matter little in the pursuit of selfish interests . it is important to counter al-shabaab directly , including by military means . but there wo n't be any lasting solution to the wider region 's security problems without a more comprehensive and concerted effort to address the deeper problems of exclusion suffered by the citizens of the countries challenged by al-shabaab . as garissa shows , these problems are still providing oxygen for nihilistic ideologies and their deadly fruit . copyright 2015 the conversation . some rights reserved .
<s> judge wo n't allow teen leave hospital before her last chemotherapy treatment . </s> <s> attorneys for the teen are deciding whether to appeal . </s> <s> cassandra c. is now in remission and is no longer opposed to the chemotherapy treatments . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- a connecticut teen who has been forced to have chemotherapy to treat hodgkin lymphoma will remain in temporary custody of the state for the time being , according to her attorney , josh michtom . a connecticut juvenile court judge issued a written decision wednesday denying a motion to let the teen , identified in court documents as `` cassandra c. , '' go home . the judge also denied a motion for visitation . the 17-year-old is in remission after nearly six months of forced chemo treatments . on march 16 , michtom tried to convince the court that she should be able to return to her mother 's home because she was no longer at imminent risk of harm from her illness . michtom and attorney michael taylor , who represents cassandra 's mother , jackie fortin , released a written statement after receiving the judge 's decision wednesday : `` we are disappointed in this ruling , not least of all because it draws a factual conclusion that is directly contradicted by the weight of the evidence . we 're conferring with our clients now about next steps , including whether to take another appeal . '' cassandra was diagnosed with hodgkin lymphoma in september and medical experts gave her an 85 % chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy . without it , doctors said at the time , she was likely to die within two years . she started chemotherapy in november but ran away after two days , according to court documents , when she decided she did not want to put the poison of the treatment into her body . in december , a judge ordered the young woman to be under the custody of the connecticut department of children and families . at that time , she was admitted to connecticut children 's medical center in hartford and has remained there since then . doctors surgically implanted a port in cassandra 's chest to administer chemotherapy medications , which began in spite of legal maneuvers to halt them . cassandra is feeling well and is in good shape as far as her health is concerned , according to michtom . `` she 's seen in her case the side effects were n't bad , and she 's been well-treated by the nurses and doctors and does want to complete the treatment , '' he said . her treatment is scheduled to wrap up this month . michtom and taylor failed in their effort before the connecticut supreme court to make the case that cassandra was mature enough to make her own medical decisions . joette katz , the commissioner of the department of children and families , told cnn in march the agency is `` very pleased with cassandra 's progress toward a complete recovery . we understand how difficult this has been for cassandra and her family , but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life . '' the agency has denied cnn 's request to speak with cassandra or her physicians . according to michtom , the department of children and families could have withdrawn its position for an order of custody but has n't . he said the department sees cassandra as a flight risk because she has run away before . representatives for the department have said in court and in conversations with michtom and taylor that they will withdraw their pending neglect petition once cassandra completes her last round of chemo -- expected around the end of april -- and that she 'll be allowed to return home . so for now , cassandra is said to spend her days reading , watching tv and drawing . `` the hospital is effectively jail , '' michtom said .

<s> frida ghitis : president barack obama is right to want a deal , but this one gives iran too much . </s> <s> she says the framework agreement starts lifting iran sanctions much too soon . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- president barack obama tied himself to the mast of a nuclear deal with iran even before he became the democratic candidate for president . reaching a good , solid agreement with iran is a worthy , desirable goal . but the process has unfolded under the destructive influence of political considerations , weakening america 's hand and strengthening iran . obama 's political standing and his historic legacy in foreign policy are so deeply intertwined with reaching an accord with iran that if the deal ultimately collapses , he may fear that historians will conclude that his legacy in global affairs collapsed with it . there is a reason one gets the feeling that it is the united states and not iran that is the more eager , even desperate , side in these talks , even though iran is the country whose economy was sent into a deep chill by international sanctions ; the country whose only significant export , oil , lost more than half of its value in recent months . the reason is that obama has a huge political stake in these negotiations . the president may insist that the united states will choose no deal over a bad deal , but few people truly believe he has a credible plan b. few believe it , particularly in the middle east and notably among america 's arab friends , who hold the view that iran is running circles around the united states and outplayed obama . as the writer david rothkopf aptly put it , `` iran is having a great obama administration . '' that 's a belief that has already started shaking up the region . saudi arabia has said that it will pursue nuclear weapons if it believes iran has not been stopped , and there is little doubt that other countries among iran 's muslim rivals will do the same . in fact , the notion that obama is not handling the iranian threat effectively is contributing to a new war in yemen , where saudi arabia and other arabs are trying to push back against gains by iran 's allies . we can trace it all back to the democratic primaries in 2007 , when then-sen . obama said he would meet iran 's leaders `` without preconditions , '' leading his rival , hillary clinton , to call the idea `` irresponsible and frankly naive . '' as the years of his presidency unfolded , and the middle east started coming apart , finding a deal with iran started to look like the one major foreign policy achievement obama might leave behind . the political imperative started to intrude in strategic considerations on an issue that is of transcendent importance to world peace . the framework agreement announced on thursday came two days after obama 's march 31 deadline . the u.s.-imposed deadline served only to pressure the united states , and the french ambassador very publicly decried as a `` bad tactic . '' that bad tactic was a political move , a push to produce some sort of result , however vague , to protect the talks from critics . again , a solid agreement that ensures iran will not produce nuclear weapons would be a most welcome development . but the agreement so far does not look promising . it certainly shows the final outcome will differ greatly from what obama had vowed . in a presidential debate in 2012 , obama described a crystal clear goal for negotiations . `` the deal we 'll accept is they end their nuclear program . it 's very straightforward . '' nobody is talking about iran ending its nuclear program . not even close . iran will be allowed to keep one-third of its more than 6,000 centrifuges . that 's not a small symbolic number . and it does not appear as though any of its nuclear facilities will be dismantled , although fordow will contain no nuclear materials . iran has insisted all along that its nuclear program has only civilian uses . the fact is that iran has a well-established record of lying and concealing the elements of its nuclear program to u.n. inspectors . and the u.n. agency chief says that has not stopped . a couple of weeks ago , with days left until the negotiating deadline , u.n. nuclear chief yukiya amano said iran is still stonewalling . `` we are still not in a position to conclude that all nuclear material in iran is -lsb- for a -rsb- peaceful purpose , '' he warned . the negotiations ' starting point is that iran would like to have the bomb and the international community wants to delay that as much as possible -- and preferably , forever . the world only learned about iran 's secret facilities at arak and natanz after dissidents raised the alarm . iran , we have learned repeatedly , is very good at lying to international inspectors . it is well-established that it has had something to hide about its nuclear program . it is well-established that many of iran 's neighbors do n't trust it and are anxious about the u.s.-led international dealings with iran . it is well-established that iran has engaged in international terrorism and in destabilizing the region . it is also clear that it took harsh international sanctions and a collapse in oil prices to bring iran to the negotiating table . it was iran that had the most to lose from a failure of talks . but political considerations turned the united states into the supplicant . the framework agreement starts lifting those indispensable sanctions much too soon . nuclear enrichment will continue , although at a lower level . iran officially , legally , becomes a nuclear threshold state , with the capability to make the final dash to a bomb within a `` breakout '' period of one year , the time when presumably inspectors would discover violation and allow the rest of the world to act . even the fordow facility , conveniently inside a fortified bunker in a mountain , will remain in existence , though `` converted '' to a nuclear `` research facility '' and without nuclear material on site . international sanctions lifting will begin almost immediately . its nuclear infrastructure will remain largely in place , even if operating at a reduced pace , giving iran much of what it wanted . with iranian forces gaining ground in arab lands and iranian commanders declaring the destruction of israel `` nonnegotiable '' and threatening saudi arabia , this deal does not look reassuring . obama is right that a diplomatic solution is the most desirable option . but the deal so far looks like -lrb- another -rrb- win for iran . it introduces enough restrictions that it could give the president the political cover he wants , but it does not do enough to make the world safe from nuclear proliferation and more potentially catastrophic instability in the middle east .

'' the cdc advises that individuals and institutions should check their freezers for the recalled products and throw them away . in a statement on its website , blue bell said `` this recall in no way includes blue bell ice cream half gallons , pints , quarts , 3 gallons or other 3 oz . cups . '' this has been the first product recall in the 108-year history of blue bell creameries , the company said . listeriosis is a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria , and primarily affects the elderly , pregnant women , newborns and people with weakened immune systems , according to the cdc . symptoms of a listeria infection are fever and muscle aches , sometimes associated with diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms . in the united states , an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year , and approximately 16 % of these illnesses result in death . cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in stillbirth or spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters . cnn 's debra goldschmidt , amanda watts and jacque wilson contributed to this report .

'' the individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals , and not public figures ; the latter have a harder time proving defamation . a private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person 's reputation . the private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false , or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis , or acted negligently in checking the facts . at first blush , that sounds like it fits perfectly , right ? the columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent . but that 's only half the battle . there are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this . the identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters . first , let 's eliminate uva . the university is a public university , and therefore it is a governmental entity . the supreme court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government : the government can not sue for defamation . there is no such cause of action in american jurisprudence . now the fraternities , starting with phi kappa psi . a fraternity is not an individual , but a group . a plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were `` of or concerning '' the plaintiff . it sounds obvious , but if you 're going to say a statement hurt you , you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with . when the statements are about a group without naming an individual , it 's hard to say the statement is `` concerning '' the individual -- and groups generally can not sue . for example , you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief , but that same person can not sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves . defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group 's individual members , for the most part . like all rules , however , there are exceptions . if the defamatory language is about `` a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group , an individual member may sue . '' if i said , `` the 1980 philadelphia phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals '' -lrb- they were n't -rrb- , the individual players could sue , because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if i said that -- which i did n't . phi kappa psi would likely argue that the `` small group '' exception fits it perfectly : even if the individual members were not identified by name , the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members , who have suffered by their association with the group . on the other hand , rolling stone 's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid -lrb- after all , the membership changes somewhat every year -rrb- , that even though the fraternity 's reputation is tarnished , the members have suffered no individualized injury . as for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story , that 's likely a group that moves from the small category to large , and the members of greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit . lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on facebook , but that such cases are rarely actually filed . that 's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm . so if your aunt edna calls you a loser on twitter , you 're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially . and since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits on facebook live in their moms ' basements and are `` between jobs , '' these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place . the uva situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case . the university wo n't be able to sue , but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim , and they can make a tangible case for damages , then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases .

'' while an saf superintendent said at a eulogy for the fallen commandos that their sacrifice had been worth it , controversy has dogged the botched mission in the philippines . the ipac report argued that the `` single-minded focus '' of authorities on killing marwan has threatened the peace agreement with the milf , which is yet to cross the final hurdle of being passed into law by the philippines congress . `` the best chance the southern philippines has ever had for peace may now be in jeopardy , '' read the report , which argued that the mamapasano fiasco was the result of a misguided emphasis on killing marwan . the report argued that , although marwan had aided terror attacks and provided funds and equipment to milf and abu sayyaf , he was not `` the master bomber that his reputation suggested . '' yet for the philippines authorities and their u.s. allies , killing marwan had become such a priority that security forces bypassed the mechanisms that had been established to alert the milf to such operations , for fear of word leaking to their target . the report quoted an anonymous indonesian associate of marwan 's who described the malaysian as `` a little snake who has been blown up into a dragon .

'' taiga ishikawa , tokyo councillor and the first male gay local assembly member in japan , told cnn the ordinance was a `` big first step for the protection of human rights . '' he called the decision `` happy '' but said that it must go alongside education about alternative lifestyles . he said that the most important part of today 's announcement is that it `` should be actually put into practice , as should education for understanding -lrb- lgbt individuals -rrb- especially they suffer as they find out their sexuality when they are young . '' neighboring setagaya ward has indicated that it would look into following shibuya 's lead . however , former councilor ishikawa cautioned against taking the movement 's momentum for granted . `` to realize equal rights for gay couples , a national law has to be made , '' he said . while outright discrimination against the lgbt community is rare in japan , its effects can be hidden and gay people often find themselves at a disadvantage . many hide their sexuality from their employers , co-workers , families and friends . but the tide may be turning . a recent poll found that a slight majority at 52.4 % oppose gay marriage , but support amongst young adults in their 20s and 30s is as high as 70 % . an editorial in the asahi shimbun newspaper , which commissioned the poll , welcomed the shibuya decision , calling it `` a bold and important step forward . '' only traditional marriages are recognized under japan 's constitution , but the wording is vague enough to open it to interpretation , according to mari miura , a professor of gender and politics at sophia university in tokyo . `` the constitution does not rule out same-sex marriage , so an interpretation can be made that it is constitutional , '' miura told bloomberg business . while prime minister shinzo abe and the ruling liberal democratic party `` do n't like the idea of same-sex marriage , but at the same time the issue is gaining momentum . '' conservative groups were vocal in their opposition , with one , known as the network pushing for normalization of education , telling the japan times that granting same-sex couples the same rights as all other japanese citizens would degrade the `` familial system and practice that heterosexual unions have long preserved in human history . '' while shibuya 's registration system will be a first for japan , yodogawa ward in the western japanese city of osaka was the first in the nation to recognize and support the lgbt community . in 2013 the ward government pledged to give consideration to the issues that the community faced , and to train staff to accommodate needs specific to lgbt individuals . journalist chie kobayashi contributed reporting from tokyo .

'' final test results were expected next week . the epa is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on march 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated . `` pesticides can be very toxic , and it is critically important that they be applied properly and used only as approved by epa , '' said judith a. enck , a regional administrator for the epa . `` the epa is actively working to determine how this happened and will make sure steps are taken to prevent this from happening to others at these vacation apartments or elsewhere .

'' i have no doubt that under paul 's leadership , he would indeed take our country back -- in the wrong direction -- way back to a time when we were debating the civil rights act -- which paul has done since landing on the national stage ; when there was no department of education -- a department he thinks `` should be done away with ; '' when women did n't have choices -- choices paul seeks to limit in washington ; when dreamers were n't protected from deportation -- protections paul currently opposes . in his inept speaking engagements at historically black colleges and universities , he has come across as condescending and lacking basic cultural competency . but paul has also questioned the civil rights act , and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate . when asked about the need for a more robust voting rights act following the supreme court 's dismantling of the law , paul dismissively remarked , `` we have an african-american president . '' when president obama stood with john lewis and other veterans of the civil rights movement in front of the edmund pettus bridge last month to mark the 50th anniversary of bloody sunday , he inspired us all by saying : `` with effort , we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity . ... with effort , we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge -- and that is the right to vote . '' america is better -- and we solve more problems -- with more democracy , not less . unfortunately rand paul has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle . paul tried once again from that stage in louisville to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden republican appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year . but his record makes it very clear that his views are outdated , outside of the mainstream , and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead our country . the american people deserve a leader who wo n't disrespect their intelligence , who wo n't pander to them when it 's convenient , and who wo n't work to dismantle the progress we have made over the last five decades . what i heard today , did n't change the facts about rand paul 's record . the american people deserve better than rand paul .
<s> justice department prosecuting fedex over unauthorized shipment of drugs . </s> <s> danny cevallos : fedex has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- the united states department of justice has named a new defendant in the war on drugs , and the charges are serious indeed . a 15-count indictment filed in federal court in california bristles with accusations of conspiracies , transporting prescription pharmaceuticals dispensed with illegal prescriptions , violations of the controlled substances act , misbranding charges , and money laundering charges . who is this menace to society ? fedex . yes , the courier delivery service . wait , can companies even be charged with crimes ? where would a fedex be incarcerated ? is there a corporate shawshank prison ? how does one fit a company for a prison jumpsuit ? it turns out a corporation can indeed be prosecuted like a person . it 's a practice the supreme court has approved of for over a century . in fact , in many ways they are easier to prosecute than people . corporations do n't have all the same inconvenient constitutional rights as citizens accused of crimes . imprisoning convicted citizens is expensive , but corporate convictions , on the other hand , turn tidy profits for the u.s. government , with zero prison overhead . even if corporations can be held criminally liable , should a courier service like fedex be held liable for `` possessing '' what bad guys may send through the service ? the answer , according to fedex , is not just `` no , '' but a `` no '' so conclusive that this case should never see a courtroom . the company maintains that it is innocent . it has a point . `` possession '' is an elusive concept . when it comes to drugs , the law recognizes two kinds of possession : actual and constructive . actual possession is when you have physical control over the contraband . when you have a gun in your hand or drugs in your pocket , you `` actually '' possess those things . the somewhat hazier concept of `` constructive possession '' means you can `` possess '' something without even having it on your person , as long as you have ownership , dominion or control over the contraband or the property where it is found . for example , the government would argue that while you may not have actual possession of the 5,000 oxycontin pills in the trunk of your car parked in your driveway , you `` constructively '' possessed them . conversely , sometimes you can be holding something in your hand or have it in your vehicle , but not `` possess '' it either actually or constructively , in the eyes of the law . such is the case with couriers who routinely drive to your home , walk up to your door and hand you a package , completely ignorant about what is inside it . it 's hard to argue the ups guy intentionally `` possessed '' your subscription to porno mags , in their nondescript brown packaging . that is the idea behind the `` common carrier '' exception to possession , and a large part of fedex 's compelling legal argument . a `` common carrier '' is one who offers its services to members of the public -- without much discretion -- and is engaged in the business of transporting persons or property for compensation . the public policy reasons behind `` common carrier '' exemptions make sense ; the industry simply could n't function if every driver , courier and handler who touches a valid shipment of oxycontin had to obtain a prescription for opiates to be legally allowed to deliver it to your front door . that would lead to an absurd result . that 's why the controlled substances act and the food , drug , and cosmetic act allow common carriers to lawfully possess controlled substances , so long as it is in the usual course of their business . of course , this is not a permission slip for drug runners to avoid liability by calling themselves `` common carriers . '' that 's why the `` usual course of business '' language acts as an additional safety measure . in court papers , fedex 's lawyers offer the example of an airline whose sole activity was flying controlled substances from jamaica to miami . this would not be acting in the usual course of business of a common carrier , since this imaginary airline is not offering its services to the public , generally . on the other hand , fedex argues that it is indeed a common carrier , performing the normal duties of a common carrier , because -lrb- a -rrb- it is engaged in the business of transportation of property and -lrb- b -rrb- it offers its services to the public generally . it 's hard to imagine extending liability to common carriers for possession of contraband . does this mean a greyhound bus driver becomes liable for marijuana possessed by a passenger ? the bus driver would argue he has no reason to know if a particular passenger is carrying drugs . but if the guy boards the bus with a grateful dead t-shirt and a set of bongos , should n't the driver at least have a hunch ? that seems dangerously close to profiling . is this another illogical straw man argument ? maybe . obviously , the department of justice disagrees , which is why it has brought this criminal prosecution . according to the indictment , from at least as early as 2004 , the drug enforcement administration , the food and drug administration , and members of congress put fedex on notice that illegal internet pharmacies were using its shipping services to distribute controlled substances and prescription drugs in violation of the controlled substances act , the food , drug , and cosmetic act , and numerous state laws . the indictment alleges that as early as 2004 , fedex knew that it was delivering drugs to dealers and addicts . fedex 's couriers in kentucky , tennessee , and virginia expressed safety concerns that were circulated to fedex senior management . the doj is making the argument that even though fedex carries and delivers whatever is handed to it by the public , fedex knew or should have known in specific instances that it was involving itself in suspicious drug activity . it raises a larger question , though : why do we prosecute inanimate objects that we ca n't even incarcerate ? the answer is the same reason that the drug dealers deal drugs , and drug smugglers smuggle them : money . power . the government in these cases gets to impose its will and policy upon large corporations -- in this case , it would be to force fedex to help law enforcement in policing shady pharmaceutical transportation . the government also gets to extract gargantuan sums of money from corporations in `` deferred prosecution agreements . '' the reason you do n't see a lot of corporate trials is because most companies prefer to enter into such agreements ; for a company , a public prosecution alone would be tantamount to a death sentence , whether or not it 's found guilty . still , every defense attorney would love to offer the option to his or her human clients of avoiding felony conviction and a potential life sentence -- by agreeing to pay some fines . do n't get me wrong : i 'm all about prosecuting the black market , especially if that means prosecuting the guys who send us those spam emails to our work accounts with `` v1agra '' in the subject line , for our co-workers to see while we go to the bathroom . i want those guys locked up for sure . i 'm just not sure that fedex has anything to do with the kingpins of the `` fr33 cyalis '' email campaign . the doj 's underlying intentions are noble enough -- this is an attack on the supply line of the illegal drug market by attacking the actual supply chain . it makes good strategic sense . it might seem like good financial sense in the short run , with the millions in fines extracted from corporations , but that money has to come from somewhere . it 's just a matter of time before that trickles down to job cuts and less leg room on our flights . it probably does n't make good legal sense either . yes , we have been treating corporations as fictional `` persons '' for centuries in some ways -- but it 's silly to treat them as persons in all ways . fedex has a strong argument for dismissal in this case , but even if not , it wo n't be swapping its logo orange for prison orange anytime soon .
<s> `` mad men 's '' final seven episodes begin airing april 5 . </s> <s> the show has never had high ratings but is considered one of the great tv series . </s> <s> it 's unknown what will happen to characters , but we can always guess . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- this is the end . beautiful friend , the end . for the 1960s , the end arrived with -- depending on your ideals and your tribe -- either the rolling stones ' altamont fiasco in december 1969 , the kent state shootings in may 1970 or richard nixon 's 1972 re-election . for `` mad men , '' the `` end of an era , '' as its slogan has it , begins sunday . over the past eight years , the show about a 1960s advertising agency and its collision with changing times has become part of the national fabric , if never a huge ratings hit . stores have created fashion lines inspired by the show ; there have been `` mad men '' cocktails and `` mad men '' museum exhibits and even `` mad men '' presidential references . don draper , the creative director played by jon hamm , has become a symbol of the times -- his and , sometimes , ours . its subjects have taken the show to heart . in march , a `` mad men '' bench was unveiled in front of new york 's time & life building , where the fictional firm of sterling cooper & partners has its headquarters . the end of a tv series brings with it some risk . `` the sopranos , '' `` mad men '' creator matthew weiner 's former employer , divided fans with its famous cut-to-black finale . on the other hand , `` mad men 's '' former amc stablemate , `` breaking bad , '' was saluted for an almost perfect landing . speaking of landings : the last season -- technically , the first half of season 7 -- ended with the moon landing in july 1969 . though weiner and his cast have been typically tight-lipped -- weiner even hid the finale from his cast at first -- it 's reasonable to assume the new season will pick up soon afterward . what 's going to happen ? here are some educated guesses . with the '60s screaming towards their conclusion , `` mad men '' probably wo n't jump ahead much . the latter half of 1969 included the manson murders , the woodstock festival , a new york mayoral campaign and the vietnam war moratorium demonstrations -- plenty of fodder for the characters to interact with , if only tangentially . who knows ? the show might even mention the miracle mets . it would be a nice way to acknowledge the agency 's late lane pryce . of course , weiner might have a different idea ; he 's from baltimore . `` mad men '' is generally a show about disintegration , reflective of the '60s themselves . the old orders are falling apart : white-shoe wasp firms like sterling cooper giving way to the ethnic pace-setters such as doyle dane bernbach ; grimy new york replaced by sunny los angeles ; the `` good war '' generation butting heads with the `` make love , not war '' cohort ; vacuum tubes and ledger books being displaced by a sleek , solid-state ibm world . it 's all an ad agency can do to keep up . last season saw plenty of intraoffice turmoil , thanks to the ill-fitting merger between sterling cooper and former rival cutler gleason and chaough . though the agency survived , it 's now without bert cooper -lrb- robert morse -rrb- and under the ownership of -lrb- real-life -rrb- madison avenue titan mccann erickson . that 's not a recipe for long-term survival , and expect a number of longtime characters -- ken cosgrove -lrb- aaron staton -rrb- , harry crane -lrb- rich sommer -rrb- and perhaps even joan harris -lrb- christina hendricks -rrb- -- to look for an exit . roger sterling -- the wisecracking executive played by john slattery -- might find an exit as well , but not one he 's anticipating . he 's suffered two heart attacks . he drinks to excess . he 's never grown up . bet on a sudden and shocking departure . on the other hand , peggy olson 's star has continued to rise -lrb- much like one of the character 's models , advertising wunderkind mary wells lawrence -rrb- . she left sterling cooper once ; indeed , she would n't have returned if her new agency had n't merged with her old one . if olson , played by elisabeth moss , bolts the firm , it will probably be to head her own agency -- and possibly get married . that is , if she 's still interested in such an old-fashioned tradition . in recent seasons , don 's ex-wife , betty -lrb- january jones -rrb- , has lost herself amid all the turmoil . she sees herself through the eyes of her spouses , and though husband henry francis -lrb- christopher stanley -rrb- has been far more supportive than don , he 's a busy man . and sally , don 's daughter -lrb- kiernan shipka -rrb- , is proving to be a handful . on the one hand , she 's obviously bright ; on the other , she 's a teenager and starting to rebel . in recent seasons she 's run away and started sneaking cigarettes , and she 's always fighting with her mother . you could see her hitchhiking to woodstock , or at least dropping out of school . anything 's possible , but given all that the character has been through -- divorces , affairs , office politics , morose late-night rides with glen bishop -- it 's a bit on the nose , is n't it ? instead , try this : it 's april 1 , 1970 . richard nixon is signing legislation banning cigarette ads on radio and television , reminding don of the day 10 years earlier when he came up with the lucky strike campaign that began the series . no fool , he had seen this day coming years before . he 'll fix himself a drink , ponder buying an avocado-colored refrigerator , clean out his ashtray and leave the show the way he arrived : on top of the zeitgeist , unable to accept his past and utterly , inscrutably alone .

'' twitter user yeshacallahan posted . appearing on cnn , washington defended the tweet , saying he wanted to `` excite a conversation . '' years ago , rock filmed a sketch for his `` chris rock '' show on hbo in which he detailed ways to avoid being beaten by police as a black man . besides obeying the law , he suggested bringing a white friend along for the ride . he did just that last year in a segment of `` comedians in cars getting coffee '' with jerry seinfeld . the two chat as seinfeld drives an orange lamborghini . and what happened ? they get pulled over after seinfeld goes a bit heavy on the gas . `` here 's the crazy thing , '' rock tells seinfeld as the police officer stops the duo . `` if you were n't here , i 'd be scared .

<s> jay parini : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture , it 's worth looking at message of holy week and easter . </s> <s> he says ritual enactment of these three days is reminder that again and again the human condition moves through darkness into light . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- easter is unique on the christian calendar , a major point in the cycle of the religious year , and one that has always been able to resist the commercialization and culture warring that surrounds christmas . that 's in part because easter is genuinely about how religious impulses , and patterns , can operate in ways that affect our lives . nevertheless , i 'm often surprised by how little people , even those supposedly within the christian tradition , actually know about what is called holy week and its culmination on easter sunday . at a time when our culture is roiled by questions of identity and ethics -lrb- and tolerance -rrb- that have profound religious implications , it 's worth pausing to explore this crucial holiday -- and the awareness of the human condition , in all its sadness and glory , that it engenders . after all , holy week calls mostly to those who incline their minds and hearts in its direction with seriousness of intent . still , the fuss must puzzle those looking on , wondering what it all means . why do christians make so much of this springtime week , and make so much of easter weekend ? there is a phrase that many never come across , even among christians : easter triduum . this refers to the three days of easter that begin with good friday , proceed through holy saturday , and conclude with easter sunday . it 's definitely a progression , although the word itself -- triduum -- can refer to any three days of prayer . easter triduum has a kind of major prologue in maundy thursday , the day when , by tradition , jesus celebrated the last supper with his disciples in the upper room in jerusalem on the night before he was crucified . the idea of holy communion begins with this meal , which was a passover meal . jesus , of course , was jewish , as were all his disciples . he was never trying to erase judaism and found a new religion . his work involved modifying and extending judaism in fresh ways . on maundy thursday , christians sometimes practice the washing of feet , recalling that jesus washed the very dusty feet of his disciples at the last supper as a way of demonstrating profound humility -- showing that he was himself a servant -- and modeling a kind of ideal behavior . good friday is n't , in fact , so good . it 's the day of the crucifixion , when jesus was scourged and beaten , forced to carry his cross to golgotha , the `` place of the skull , '' and nailed to the cross itself for what must have been an agonizing death . the actual scene of the crucifixion varies from gospel to gospel , as do his last words , assembled into the so-called `` seven last words '' of jesus by adding up fragments from different gospels . some of these words are quotations , as when jesus asked god why he has abandoned him : this is a quote from the 22nd psalm , which opens : `` my god , my god , why hast thou forsaken me ? '' good friday is a day of death , sacrifice , displacement , fear . holy saturday is probably the least understood day of the easter triduum . it 's a passageway between the darkness of the crucifixion and the bright hope of easter . this day occupies an anxious space in human experience , when the certain knowledge of something dreadful is n't quite erased -- ca n't be erased -- simply by hope . it 's a day of depression , a day of suspension . then comes easter , with the aura of the resurrection . i 'm always moved by the deep symbolism of this mythic moment , when the body of christ becomes what is called a `` glorified body . '' this was not , as i 've said elsewhere , the great resuscitation , although that 's part of it , too . resurrection implies a total transformation , something beyond the physical realm . it 's very important that almost nobody who encounters jesus after the resurrection can really recognize him , know him , or understand him as the same person who was with them before he was crucified . easter embraces the great mystery of resurrection , with its promise of transformation -- a shift from one form to another , and a change that moves well beyond any literal understanding . the three days of easter , the triduum , occur only once a year on the calendar . but the really interesting thing is that we all experience the pattern of the three days again and again . we find ourselves emptied out in small ways , nailed to our own trees in life , embarrassed or broken by life . it was the buddha who famously observed that life is suffering . good friday embodies the christian version of that truth . jesus suffered in the way all of us must suffer . we must all die , perhaps less ignominiously but just as certainly . our friends and families must die . we all experience illness , loss , sadness , a loss of confidence , darkness . this is simply part of the human experience . we dive again and again into holy saturday , too -- a period of transition , when the bleakness of suffering is perhaps slightly behind us but nothing restorative seems in view . we know well this in-between time ; it 's an anxious passage , with only a glimmer on the horizon of potential hope . and we 've all been resurrected , again and again , perhaps in tiny ways . this is the joy of easter , and it 's not something reserved for one day on the calendar . it 's there whenever we experience what t.s. eliot once called the `` timeless moment , '' which can only occur -- paradoxically -- in time itself . it 's a mystical point where timelessness intersects with time . i suspect we all experience the triduum frequently , sometimes more than once in a single day . but the ritual enactment of these three days of the easter season reminds all of those who practice christianity -- and perhaps those who do n't -- that we should expect to move through darkness into light . it 's a pattern that describes a kind of spiritual progression . it 's good cause for celebration , too : and one that wo n't easily be co-opted by secular culture .
<s> some of jesus ' most important financial backers were women , historians say . </s> <s> joseph of arimathea and nicodemus , both men of stature and wealth , chipped in to help fund jesus ' ministry . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- `` sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; then come , follow me , '' jesus tells the rich man in one of his best-known parables . it was a mantra he invoked repeatedly : the poor were blessed , and it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it was for the well-to-do to enter paradise . meanwhile , jesus told his twelve apostles to leave their day jobs and follow him on an itinerant mission with few prospects of success and no visible means of support . so how did this wandering band of first-century evangelists support themselves ? clearly , money was a concern , and not just as an impediment to salvation . in the new testament , money gets 37 mentions , while `` gold '' gets 38 citations , `` silver '' merits 20 , and `` copper '' four . `` coin '' comes up eight times , and `` purse '' and `` denarii '' -- the roman currency -- get half a dozen mentions each for a total of 119 currency referrals . perhaps the most relevant reference is also one of the most charged passages in the new testament : . as the gospel of john tells it , six days before passover , jesus was in bethany at the house of his friend lazarus , whom he had raised from the dead . a woman named mary takes a jar of costly perfumed oil and anoints the feet of the reclining jesus . she dries his feet with her hair , an irresistible image for artists and dramatists . judas iscariot objected to the act . `` why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor ? '' judas asks . though 300 denarii was the annual wage of a laborer , jesus told judas to leave her alone , and foreshadowing his fate , said the anointing would be useful for his burial , and besides , `` you always have the poor with you '' -- but jesus would not always be there . what that passage makes clear is that the jesus community had a common purse because they needed money to survive . so how much ? `` i imagine the ministry functioned at a subsistence level , '' rabbi joshua garroway , a professor of early christianity and the second commonwealth at hebrew union college in los angeles . jesus and his disciples walked , wore what they had , slept outside or in stayed in friends ' homes . they ate what they caught or what others shared . `` i venture to guess that begging and hospitality will have sufficed to meet the basic needs of jesus and the companions with whom he traveled , '' garroway said . garroway said that it was possible , even likely , that jesus and his followers received donations from supporters , and possibly substantial ones from some of the rich people who were drawn to his ministry despite -- or perhaps because of -- his preaching on the perils of wealth . the gospel of luke gives us a glimpse of how jesus ' ministry functioned on a practical level : . `` soon afterwards he went on through cities and villages , proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of god . the twelve were with him , as well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities : mary , called magdalene , from whom seven demons had gone out , and joanna , the wife of herod 's steward chuza , and susanna , and many others , who provided for them out of their resources . '' so , according to luke , women whom jesus had healed in turn provided for him out of their `` resources , '' with mary magdalene and joanna capturing our attention -- one by virtue of her husband , and the other , by her stature in the story of jesus . joanna was an upper-class woman married to a man who was intelligent and capable enough to manage the complicated household of herod antipas , the son of herod the great , the violent and ambitious head of judea . as part of this volatile but powerful household , joanna would be uniquely positioned to help jesus with her resources , being both wealthy and having palace connections . she attends to him during his life , and , the gospels tell us , after his death , as one of the trio of women who go to his tomb and find it empty . with her on that morning is mary magdalene , also identified as -- among other things -- a financial supporter of jesus . mary likely came from the prosperous town of magdala , on the sea of galilee . as home to a thriving fishing industry , as well as dye and textile works , mary could well have come from an affluent family -- or have been a successful business woman herself . mary magdalene was free to travel the country with jesus and his disciples , so was unlikely to have a husband and children waiting for her at home , and in `` finding jesus '' we examine the gnostic gospel of mary magdalene and explore the argument that jesus was , in fact , her husband . she may have simply been an independent woman with her own resources who found a compelling message , and messenger . not only was mary magdalene one of jesus ' most devoted followers , who stuck with him all the way from galilee to jerusalem , from the ministry to the cross and the tomb , but also she provided for him from her own means , said mark goodacre , a professor of new testament and christian origins at duke university . when the gospels speak of her `` ministering '' to jesus , they are explaining that she was one of the key figures in jesus ' everyday mission , goodacre continues . along with other women like joanna and susanna , she was one of those who made his mission viable . along with these women , men like joseph of arimathea and nicodemus , both men of stature and wealth , may have chipped in to help fund jesus ' ministry . the gospels reveal that both these men were rich , and supported jesus -- indeed , it was joseph who removed jesus from the cross on good friday , anointing his body with the help of nicodemus , and placing him in the tomb that joseph had reserved for himself . after the resurrection on that first easter sunday , the movement jesus started grew exponentially , and the church 's relationship to money grew more complicated as the needs became greater . michael mckinley is co-author , with david gibson , of `` finding jesus : faith . fact . forgery. : six holy objects that tell the remarkable story of the gospels .

<s> the trials of dzhokhar tsarnaev and aaron hernandez are coming to a close . </s> <s> voting has put rahm emanuel and ferguson , missouri , back in the headlines . </s> <s> rand paul has announced his bid for the presidency . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- the nation 's top stories will be unfolding tuesday in courthouses and political arenas across the country . massachusetts is hosting two of the highest-profile court trials in recent memory -- those of former new england patriot aaron hernandez and boston bombing suspect dzhokhar tsarnaev . both lengthy trials are coming to a close . in louisville , kentucky , sen. rand paul made the not-so-surprising announcement that he will run for president , while in chicago , voters will head to the polls in a very surprising runoff between mayor rahm emanuel and challenger jesus `` chuy '' garcia . and in ferguson , missouri , the shadow of michael brown and the protests over his shooting by officer darren wilson will loom large over the city 's elections . here 's a breakdown of what to expect today and how we got here : . tsarnaev , who 's accused of detonating a bomb at the 2013 boston marathon along with his now-deceased brother , faces the stiffest of penalties -- life in prison or the death penalty -- if he 's found guilty on any of 17 capital counts against him , including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism . the 13th juror : what defense ? on monday , survivors and victims ' families wept and tsarnaev fidgeted at a defense table as jurors heard a prosecutor allege that the 21-year-old `` brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets . '' the jury on tuesday morning began what is expected to be a lengthy deliberation process on 30 total charges , before the so-called penalty phase , should he be found guilty on any counts . it took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that hernandez killed semi-pro player odin lloyd , yet on monday , hernandez 's defense team wrapped up its witnesses in less than a day . closing arguments are scheduled for tuesday , and the jury will begin deliberations soon thereafter . jurors in fall river , massachusetts , will be asked to decide if hernandez is culpable in the shooting death of lloyd , whose body was found in a massachusetts industrial park in the summer of 2013 . much of the evidence against hernandez is circumstantial , and among the facts the jury will be asked to take into consideration are new england patriots owner robert kraft 's testimony , the testimony of hernandez 's fiancee , some grainy footage from hernandez 's home security system and a footprint left by a nike air jordan shoe . hernandez known for swagger , even in court . ok , sure , no one was floored when the kentucky senator announced his bid for the oval office , but of course it was news when he made it official tuesday . paul is expected to hit the campaign trail visiting the all-important early voters in new hampshire , south carolina , iowa and nevada . the physician rode a wave of tea party popularity into the senate in 2010 , where he carefully built a brand of mainstream libertarianism , and he is banking on a coalition of younger voters and traditional republicans to usher him into the white house . paul and sen. ted cruz are the only declared candidates for the gop nomination , though the field will certainly grow and could include the likes of florida 's jeb bush , new jersey 's chris christie , wisconsin 's scott walker , south carolina 's lindsey graham and florida 's marco rubio . would rand be here without ron ? it 's the windy city 's first runoff for a citywide office , and it 's being billed as a battle for the `` future of chicago . '' in one corner , you have emanuel , president barack obama 's notoriously hard-charging former chief of staff , and in the other , you have jesus `` chuy '' garcia , a county commissioner who has come to embody populist and liberal democrats ' frustrations with the chicago incumbent . after emanuel failed to snare half the vote in february 's general election , he will go head-to-head with garcia . the timing is interesting , too , as easter , passover and spring break appear to have spurred more than 142,000 early votes , up from about 90,000 before the first round of voting in february . following michael brown 's death , the national spotlight shone on ferguson , particularly how the city 's predominantly black population is woefully underrepresented in its police force and city council . yet with all the hubbub about the face of civic leadership , only four in 10 city residents hit the polls in november to cast ballots . residents speak out ahead of vote . tuesday 's election will bring change , no matter how the ballots are cast : two black men are running for one of the open seats , and the current lone black council member is n't up for re-election . in another ward , two black women and two white men are vying for an open seat . and a white protester is running for a third post .
<s> ted cruz has built a brand as a stalwart conservative on fiscal issues . </s> <s> but he 's also eager to champion social issues at a time when many republicans are eager to avoid them . </s> <s> cruz says the gop needs to unite young libertarian-minded voters and evangelicals . </s><sec>cedar falls , iowa -lrb- cnn -rrb- as aides politely tried to rush ted cruz from an event in cedar falls to one in cedar rapids , iowa , on thursday , the presidential candidate continued shaking hands with anyone who wanted to meet him . finally , after the selfies and conversations started to die down , his aides managed to move him closer to the door when a tall , burly man stopped him . `` senator , '' he said , `` can i pray with you real quick ? '' `` yeah , '' cruz said , as he clasped the man 's upper arm and the two bowed their heads . it was one of the many moments when cruz connected with voters on a religious level last week , as the senator from texas hit the trail in iowa for the first time as a presidential candidate . being the only official contender in the race , cruz drew large crowds during his two-day swing across the state . he 's counting on iowa , known for its vocal and active evangelical base , to propel him forward in what 's expected to be a tough competition among a crowded field of gop candidates . cruz , himself , displays a pastoral swagger when he is speaking on stage and working a room . the senator regularly avoids using a podium , instead favoring pacing the stage with a wireless microphone , a scene reminiscent of a sunday morning sermon . when he meets with people after events , he embraces each one 's hand with both of his , softens his usually theatric tone and looks people square in the eye -- a familiar interaction between churchgoing christians and their pastors . the past two winners of iowa 's caucuses rose to victory with support from the christian right , and cruz , who announced his bid last month at the well-known baptist school liberty university , is aiming to energize that same base and claim the coveted state as his prize . evangelicals make up a large segment of iowa 's republican voter bloc . according to a des moines register/bloomberg politics poll from january , 44 % of likely 2016 republican caucus-goers said they were born-again or evangelical christians . cruz has built a brand as a stalwart conservative willing to buck gop leadership on fiscal issues , but he showed in iowa last week that he 's also eager to champion social issues at a time when many republicans are anxious to avoid them . he was one of the loudest defenders of the religious freedom law in indiana , which came under fire last week for what critics called paving a path to discrimination against gays and lesbians . he described the outrage over the laws as `` shameful '' and an `` assault '' on first amendment rights . `` there are a lot of people here in iowa and across the country whose hearts are breaking , watching what has happened in the last two weeks , '' cruz said friday night at an event in des moines . `` we have seen a grossly unfair vilification of religious liberty . '' related : republican 2016 hopefuls back indiana 's ` religious freedom ' law . he 's more than comfortable talking about his own faith and telling the story of how his father became a christian and a pastor . rafael cruz , who 's become a celebrity among christian conservatives , will frequently visit iowa over the next year , cruz told voters . and cruz 's iowa director , bryan english , is a former pastor . cruz 's first television ads are appearing this weekend during programs on fox news and nbc that are pegged to easter sunday . in the ad , cruz talks about the impact of the `` transformative love of jesus christ '' on his life . while neither mike huckabee , who won iowa in 2008 , nor rick santorum , who won in 2012 , went on to win the nomination , their successes helped launch them into high-profile battles with the then-front-runners . and with both of them likely running again in 2016 , the competition will be stiff . that 's why , for cruz , courting evangelicals is only a component of a three-pronged strategy to win the nomination that also includes dominating the tea party faction and competing for the libertarian base . his stump speech hits on elements that appeal to each faction . he received standing ovations last week for calling to abolish the irs , and , in a knock against the national security agency , he frequently tells audiences to leave their cell phones on so president obama `` can hear every word i have to say . '' cruz argued thursday that the republican party needs to bridge the gap between what he described as the ron paul-rand paul faction of the party -- young libertarian-minded voters -- and the santorum base -- evangelicals . the two blocs , he said , are `` not necessarily the best of chums . '' `` if we 're going to win , we 've got to bring that coalition together , '' he said in cedar falls . `` and i think we can do that . '' cruz frequently says he wants to see a return of the evangelical vote to 2004 levels , when more than six in 10 evangelicals voted in the presidential election , a higher than normal turnout for the demographic . that number has waned slightly since 2004 -- but it 's not too far off from the 56 % of the overall population that voted in 2012 . still , his campaign believes that if it can tap into the group of evangelicals who 've been staying home and get the demographic as a whole to overperform , then that could mean the difference of millions more at the polls . `` if you look at available places for the party to expand the vote , it does n't exist in the middle , it exists in the evangelical vote , '' said rick tyler , a top cruz adviser . `` it is n't a pond , it 's an unfished ocean of available voters who are conservative . '' russell moore , president of the ethics & religious liberty commission of the southern baptist convention , said he expects to see record turnout among evangelicals in 2016 no matter who the nominee is or what that person says . moore points to hot-button topics like religious freedom issues in the u.s. , as well as increased attention to the killing of minority christians in the middle east and rising anti-semitism . `` i do n't think a candidate is going to be able to get very far simply by using evangelical lingo or by pointing to his or her personal faith , '' moore said . `` i think a candidate is going to have to explain how he or she would protect religious liberty and would appoint justices and judges who will maintain the common good . '' later in april , voters in iowa will see the bulk of the gop field tackle these issues when they take the stage at an event hosted by the iowa faith and freedom coalition . while the past two winners of the iowa caucuses -- santorum and huckabee -- are likely running for president again , steve scheffler , president of the group , argued that the field is wide open in terms of who 's going to win favor among evangelicals . jeb bush , while not popular among conservative activists , was known for his staunch anti-abortion record as florida governor and touts his catholic faith as a big force behind his policy views . scott walker is the son of a pastor . ben carson , the former neurosurgeon , rose to fame in conservative circles after criticizing the obama administration at a national prayer breakfast . and other likely candidates -- from marco rubio to rick perry to rand paul -- have made serious efforts to court the religious right . `` it 's up for grabs . it 's a clean slate regardless of if you 've run before , '' scheffler said . `` naturally those two -lrb- huckabee and santorum -rrb- have the name recognition and database of people who supported them in the past , but by and large voters are going to say , ` let me take a good look at all of these candidates .

'' now , prosecutors have accused zhou of `` taking advantage of his posts to seek benefits for others and illegally accepting huge amounts of money '' during his long political career . his alleged actions have caused heavy losses to public assets and greatly harmed national interests , they added . zhou was notified of his legal rights during the investigation and his lawyer 's views were heard , according to a statement by the prosecutors . his case will be tried in tianjin , a city near the chinese capital , beijing . the president of china 's supreme court recently told reporters there would be `` open '' trials for accused former leaders like zhou . however , the charge of leaking state secrets may allow authorities to shield certain legal proceedings from public view in zhou 's case . zhou has not been seen in public since he attended an anniversary event at his alma mater in october 2013 . he was expelled from the communist party and arrested last december . state media have painted an intricate web of officials , cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around zhou before the crumbling of his power structure last summer . zhou and his family members were said to have accumulated enormous wealth , in a blatant exchange between money and power . he was also found to have affairs with multiple women and allegedly traded power for sex , state-run xinhua news agency reported last year . analysts have viewed his shocking downfall as a watershed moment in the secretive world of chinese politics , now ruled by president xi jinping . xi has been spearheading a massive anti-corruption campaign , targeting both `` tigers '' and `` flies '' -- high-ranking , and low-level , officials . zhou is by far the biggest tiger caught in xi 's dragnet to date . `` the important thing here is that xi has proven he 's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former politburo standing committee members , '' longtime political analyst willy lam , a professor at the chinese university of hong kong , said last year , when the government revealed its formal investigation into zhou . many observers also note zhou 's patronage of bo xilai , a former communist leader sentenced to life in prison for corruption in 2013 . bo 's spectacular downfall the year before -- complete with tales of murder , bribery and betrayal -- attracted global attention . state media have cited his subsequent conviction as a prime example of xi 's resolve to clean up the party . the former chongqing communist party chief 's supporters , however , have long called him a political victim -- the former high-flying politician was once considered xi 's main challenger for the top spot of chinese leadership . political watchers see similarities between the bo and zhou cases . `` the people being investigated for corruption are on the losing side of factional struggles , '' said lam , who has predicted a suspended death sentence for zhou .

'' this revelation led him to make the decision to pose as a black man , both to `` dramatically improve '' his chances of admission , and to illustrate the unfair advantage that blacks and other underrepresented minorities receive when applying to prestigious schools . to accomplish this goal , chokalingam shaved his head of its naturally wavy black locks , trimmed his `` long indian-american eyelashes , '' checked `` black '' under the optional race/ethnicity declaration and submitted his application to 14 schools under his childhood nickname `` jojo . '' he received invitations for in-person interviews at 11 schools , results that he claims support the notion that african-americans garner special privileges that are unavailable to whites or asians . and now that the statute of limitations on his act of fraud has expired , he 's looking to write a book on his experiences , titled `` almost black : the true story of an indian american who got into medical school pretending to be an african american . '' what 's truly curious is that even if you agree with chokalingam that affirmative action is merely a form of `` systematic racism , '' when all is said and done , it offers very little evidence of the `` privilege '' that he claims is accorded to black , hispanic and native american candidates . chokalingam had mediocre grades and mcats , but he graduated from one of the most prestigious schools in the nation . yet even while representing himself as black , chokalingam received only a single admission offer , to st. louis university 's school of medicine , which falls somewhere between 57th and 67th in national rankings . harvard , university of pennsylvania , columbia and all the higher ranked schools he applied to rejected him . meanwhile , he admits , pretending to be black came with disadvantages . he found himself being accused of shoplifting by store clerks and harassed by cops -- who would regularly stop him while driving and demand that he tell them how much his car cost , implying that he must have stolen it . these acts of very real prejudice , experienced regularly by blacks and hispanics of all backgrounds -- multimillionaire comedian chris rock has recently been tweeting pictures of the occasions when he is pulled over by police for no reason -- did n't seem to dissuade chokalingam from his adamant belief in the unfairness of a system that seeks to address the shockingly low numbers of minority health practitioners by providing some weight to race and ethnicity in decision-making . it 's not just a matter of what individual applicants `` deserve . '' one-third of americans are black , hispanic or native american ; just one in 10 physicians are . since minority medical practitioners are up to three times as likely to practice in their own communities , this lack of diversity has produced `` doctor deserts , '' in which urban and rural ethnic enclaves across the nation go without access to primary care physicians . years ago , when i told my father -- a doctor from a long line of doctors -- that i did n't want to follow in his footsteps , he told me that was fine , because medicine is a service trade , and anyone not interested in serving should avoid the profession . a medical degree is n't a reward to be earned , he said , but a responsibility to be accepted . which really cuts to the heart of what 's so sad about chokalingam 's racial farce . like others who 've recently been exposed for falsely claiming racial identities -- including putative presidential candidate jeb bush , who registered himself as `` hispanic '' on a 2009 voter form , and massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren , who was excoriated during her campaign for having claimed native american ancestry in the past -- chokalingam wanted to claim the fruits of racial affiliation without having to carry black people 's burden . race is n't just about color or blood ; it is about the collective experiences and inherited cultural context and present-day condition of a community of people . many of the markers of race are persistently corrosive ; others are deeply painful . affirmative action programs are a means of redress for these awful realities of our nation 's history ; an imperfect one , but necessary . there are some fields where the imbalances might never correct themselves on their own . industries like health care and hollywood . because what 's most ironic about chokalingam 's decision to ride on his sister 's coattails in telling his story : while asians are well represented in medicine , our numbers are vanishingly low in the entertainment and media world , and until the recent breakthrough of modern pioneers like mindy kaling , it was impossible to imagine film and television that included our faces , voices and stories . kaling 's immense talent and charisma made her a star . but it was a quota-based affirmative action initiative -- nbc 's diversity writers program -- that gave her a start .
<s> manuscript of `` american pie '' lyrics is sold to unnamed buyer for $ 1.2 million . </s> <s> douglas brinkley : the song , a talisman for its age , brings joy to people 44 years later . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- `` a long , long , time ago ... '' those five words , when uttered or sung , makes baby boomers immediately think of don mclean 's pop masterpiece `` american pie . '' it 's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8 1/2 minute allegory , which millions of americans know by heart , is 44 years old . all sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song , brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus , which starts as `` bye , bye , miss american pie . '' there is no real way to categorize mclean 's `` american pie '' for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad , beer-hall chant and high-art rock . on tuesday , christie 's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song 's lyrics for $ 1.2 million to an unnamed buyer . mclean was a paperboy when , on february 3 , 1959 , he saw that buddy holly , ritchie valens and j.p. `` the big bopper '' richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in clear lake , iowa . `` the next day i went to school in shock and guess what ? '' mclean recalled . `` nobody cared . rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and buddy had n't had a big hit on the charts since ' 57 . '' by cathartically writing `` american pie , '' mclean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever . having recorded his first album , `` tapestry , '' in 1969 , in berkeley , california , during the student riots , mclean , a native new yorker , became a kind of weather vane for what he called the `` generation lost in space . '' when his cultural anthem `` american pie '' was released in november 1971 , it replaced bob dylan 's `` the times they are a changin '' as the peoples almanac of the new decade . it 's important to think of `` american pie '' as one would of henry longfellow 's `` evangeline '' or johnny mercer 's `` moon river '' -- an essential americana poem emanating wistful recollection , blues valentine , and youthful protest rolled into one . there is magic brewing in the music and words of `` american pie , '' for mclean 's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream , like those jack kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel `` on the road . '' don mclean : buddy holly , rest in peace . influenced by pete seeger and the weavers , mclean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s , when `` american pie '' topped the billboard charts , and has never shed the cape . wandering far and wide , singing `` american pie '' at windblown dance halls in wyoming and cloistered colleges in new england , at huge amphitheaters in california and little coffee houses in the hudson river valley , mclean has performed his global anthem thousands of times . yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure . when mclean prods audiences by rhapsodizing `` and they were singing '' everybody spontaneously joins in with the `` bye , bye '' chorus . watching mclean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective happening . what makes `` american pie '' so unusual is that it is n't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman , which , like a sacred river , keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere . when `` american pie '' suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it 's almost impossible not to sing along . like `` danny boy '' or `` streets of laredo '' or `` shenandoah , '' it 's eternal . with illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll , river levees and nursery rhymes , the song cascades along like a boat going down niagara falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes . after all these years , `` american pie '' still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss . the song is alive and joyful , yet fretful about a world gone wrong . it is a song that will never die . a reverie for the ages . there is a jump to the chorus , which forces the mind to relive the '50s , '60s and '70s , to troll through the back pages of our lives while , like a traditional irish folksong , it reminds us of fate . while mclean , the muse , has rightfully not tried to interpret `` american pie , '' it 's fair to surmise that `` the king '' is elvis presley , `` helter skelter '' refers to the charles manson murders , the `` jester on the sidelines in a cast '' is bob dylan , and `` jack flash '' the rolling stones . but who knows ? the lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations . as a literary artifact of the early 1970s , there is n't anything to compare to `` american pie . '' normally , i do n't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents , for that matter . but the fact that the recording industry of america and the national endowment of the arts chose `` american pie '' as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition 's importance as an enduring piece of pop art . the other four were `` over the rainbow '' -lrb- by harold arlen and e.y `` yip '' harburg -rrb- , `` white christmas '' -lrb- by irving berlin -rrb- , `` this land is your land '' -lrb- by woody guthrie -rrb- and `` respect '' -lrb- by otis redding -rrb- . that is fine company . quite simply , `` american pie '' is one of the greatest songs ever written . and tuesday the original lyrics found a new home .

'' jefferson county circuit court judge laura petro had ordered hinton released after granting the state 's motion to dismiss charges against him . hinton was convicted of murder in the 1985 deaths of two birmingham-area , fast-food restaurant managers , john davidson and thomas wayne vason . but a new trial was ordered in 2014 after firearms experts testified 12 years earlier that the revolver hinton was said to have used in the crimes could not be matched to evidence in either case , and the two killings could n't be linked to each other . `` death row stories '' : hard questions about the u.s. capital punishment system . the state then declined to re-prosecute the case . hinton was 29 at the time of the killings and had always maintained his innocence , said the equal justice initiative , a group that helped win his release . `` race , poverty , inadequate legal assistance , and prosecutorial indifference to innocence conspired to create a textbook example of injustice , '' bryan stevenson , the group 's executive director and hinton 's lead attorney , said of his african-american client . `` i ca n't think of a case that more urgently dramatizes the need for reform than what has happened to anthony ray hinton . '' stevenson said the `` refusal of state prosecutors to re-examine this case despite persuasive and reliable evidence of innocence is disappointing and troubling . '' amnesty report : executions down but death sentences on the rise . dressed in a dark suit and blue shirt , hinton praised god for his release , saying he was sent `` not just a lawyer , but the best lawyers . '' he said he will continue to pray for the families of the murder victims . both he and those families have suffered a miscarriage of justice , he said . `` for all of us that say that we believe in justice , this is the case to start showing , because i should n't have -lrb- sat -rrb- on death row for 30 years , '' he said . woman who spent 22 years on death row has case tossed . hinton was accompanied friday by two of his sisters , one of whom still lives in the birmingham area . other siblings will fly to the area to see him soon , stevenson said . his mother , with whom he lived at the time of his arrest , is no longer living , according to the lawyer . hinton planned to spend at least this weekend at the home of a close friend . he will meet with his attorneys monday to start planning for his immediate needs , such as obtaining identification and getting a health checkup , stevenson said . the plan now is to spend a few weeks to get oriented with freedom and `` sort out what he wants to do , '' stevenson said .
