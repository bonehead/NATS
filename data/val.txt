'' says waring 's website , shipsnowyo.com . `` we 're in the business of expunging snow ! '' his website and social media accounts claim to have filled more than 133 orders for snow -- more than 30 on tuesday alone , his busiest day yet . with more than 45 total inches , boston has set a record this winter for the snowiest month in its history . most residents see the huge piles of snow choking their yards and sidewalks as a nuisance , but waring saw an opportunity . according to boston.com , it all started a few weeks ago , when waring and his wife were shoveling deep snow from their yard in manchester-by-the-sea , a coastal suburb north of boston . he joked about shipping the stuff to friends and family in warmer states , and an idea was born . his business slogan : `` our nightmare is your dream ! '' at first , shipsnowyo sold snow packed into empty 16.9-ounce water bottles for $ 19.99 , but the snow usually melted before it reached its destination . so this week , waring began shipping larger amounts in the styrofoam cubes , which he promises will arrive anywhere in the u.s. in less than 20 hours . he also has begun selling a 10-pound box of snow for $ 119 . many of his customers appear to be companies in warm-weather states who are buying the snow as a gag , he said . whether waring can sustain his gimmicky venture into the spring remains to be seen . but he has no shortage of product . `` at this rate , it 's going to be july until the snow melts , '' he told boston.com . `` but i 've thought about taking this idea and running with it for other seasonal items . maybe i 'll ship some fall foliage .

<s> the 20th mls season begins this weekend . </s> <s> league has changed dramatically since its inception in 1996 . </s> <s> some question whether rules regarding salary caps and transfers need to change . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- on the 6th of april 1996 , san jose clash and dc united strode out in front of 31,683 expectant fans at the spartan stadium in san jose , california . the historic occasion was the first ever major league soccer match -- a brave new dawn for the world 's favorite sport in a land its charms had yet to conquer . summarizing the action for espn , commentator ty keough eagerly described the momentous `` birth of a new era for american soccer . '' looking back at footage from that balmy evening now it 's hard not to feel a certain nostalgia . baggy shirts , questionable hairstyles and strange rule adaptations to make games more exciting were all part of the formative mls experience . countdown clocks were employed to provide drama at the end of each half . even more bizarrely , tied games were settled by shootouts that saw attacking players run with the ball from 35-yards out before attempting to beat the opposing goalkeeper . as the mls prepares to mark the beginning of its 20th season , it 's hard to comprehend just how much the league has progressed in the intervening period . long gone is the desire to tamper with the rules of the game for a start . attendances are higher than ever before while the number of teams involved has doubled from 10 in the 1996 campaign to 20 in 2015 . a further four are set to be added by 2020 . on top of this , the new season is the first of a new domestic tv and media rights deal with fox , espn and univision worth $ 700 million over eight years . this figure may pale beside the $ 5.1 billion recently paid by uk broadcasters for the english premier league , the richest football league in the world , but it represents a tripling in value of the previous mls deal . according to phil rawlins , co-primary owner and president of the new mls franchise , orlando city soccer club , `` the industry and the game itself has moved on dramatically '' in the u.s. . he believes what would equal 50 years growth in most other industries has been experienced in the first two decades of the mls . rawlins ' club is a prime example of this rapid transformation . he describes players being pushed out of changing facilities because of a schedule clash with a yoga class not so long ago . this weekend 60,000 fans are expected to witness orlando city 's opening weekend fixture against new york city , another new club making their mls bow . world cup winners kaka and david villa will turn out for orlando and new york city respectively . `` we 're just on the crest of the wave at the moment , '' rawlins said of football 's american progress . `` can it be the number two , number three sport in this country ? yes , i think it can . and it can be in a short space of time . '' these positive assertions are backed by the huge interest u.s. fans showed in last year 's world cup in brazil . team usa 's group stage clash with portugal attracted 25 million viewers , according to figures from tv ratings firm , nielsen . that 's considerably more than the 15 million baseball 's 2013 world series averaged on fox or the similar audience that tuned into the 2014 nba finals on abc . anyone who saw 20,000 pumped-up young fans pack out chicago 's grant park to cheer on their country via big screens , meanwhile , would find it hard to argue against soccer in the u.s. now being anything other than a big deal . reaching this promising stage , however , has been anything but a smooth ride . the mls was reported to have lost as much as $ 250 million in its first five years while average attendances initially dwindled after the inaugural season . three teams -- miami fusion , tampa bay mutiny -lrb- both in 2001 -rrb- and chivas usa -lrb- 2014 -rrb- -- were disbanded along the way due to a mixture of lack of fan interest and ownership troubles . a report by forbes at the end of 2013 , meanwhile , claimed that only 10 out of 19 mls teams were profitable . and as recently as this week , mls players looked like they could be going on strike over wages and the right of players to become free agents when their contracts end . then there 's the way the league develops , attracts and trades players . a salary cap restricts the amount teams can spend on playing squads . each side , however , has a number of spaces that can be allocated to `` off budget '' signings which are not included within the cap . this includes promising generation adidas players who enter the mls through the draft systems before completing their college education . homegrown players from club 's development academies are also exempt as are a maximum of three designated players -lrb- dps -rrb- , usually stellar international names whose wages and transfer fees will be covered by club owners or sponsors . one of the main criticisms of the mls and its complex player acquisition rulebook is that while it does entice prominent stars of the game like david beckham , freddie ljungberg and thierry henry to appear in the mls , it only does so when their careers are on a downward trajectory . why would an exceptional player want to move to a league that can only attract a handful of top talents at any one time , after all ? and herein lies one of the leagues biggest challenges in attracting and keeping the talented players fans want to see . although the likes of the salary cap encourages fiscal probity , it means mls teams are restricted by rules clubs in other markets are not . head coach of sporting kansas , peter vermes , highlighted these difficulties in comments carried by the kansas city star newspaper last year . `` we 're in a place where at times you ca n't compete with foreign clubs because of the kind of dynamics they have in regards to finances . we have a salary cap . they do n't , '' vermes said . according to paulo teixeira , a football agent who has worked to bring in and sell players from the league in recent years , current philosophies with regards player-trading may be have to be tweaked to help the mls grow yet further . he describes the importance of placing an emphasis on attracting younger players with european passports . such talented individuals will have a sell-on value that can be recouped by the league and their clubs if they move on from the mls to the biggest and wealthiest leagues across the atlantic . theoretically , at least , this money can then be reinvested in the league , player development and attracting yet more promising players to the mls . this in turn will raise the standard further . an early example of this strategy can perhaps be found in the transfer of oriol rossell , a spanish midfielder who moved from sporting kansas to sporting lisbon last year in a deal brokered by teixeira . rossell arrived on a free transfer aged 20 after being released by fc barcelona in 2012 . he excelled at kansas , winning the mls cup before being sold to the portuguese giants at a profit in june 2014 . teixeira is quick to make clear such plans would need good scouting systems to truly flourish . it could also be achieved by signing dps closer to the peak stage of their career , he added . this last point is something that appears be happening already . `` before they used to have a lot of big names who could no longer run in europe , '' teixeira said . '' -lrb- but -rrb- villa is not an old guy , -lrb- frank -rrb- lampard is still going strong '' and both could still offer something to teams in europe , he said by way of example of new york city 's first dp signings . nevertheless , he continued , the signing of more young players with big potential `` is probably something we 'll see more of . '' whether teixeira is correct will become apparent in the months and years ahead . either way , that brave new mls dawn that broke over san jose back in 1996 has turned into a bright morning . cnn 's don riddell contributed to this story .

'' gomis had similar fainting spells in france , which prompted the president of his former club , jean-michel aulas of lyon , to tell french television in 2009 : `` we ca n't not be worried , it scares you each time . '' swansea ran tests on gomis , said monk , prior to signing him on a free transfer last july . `` he just has a little bit of low blood pressure which causes you a little bit of problems , '' monk said in a televised interview on sky . `` it 's been part of his life . we were well aware of that when we signed him . he 's done all the hospital checks and all the medical checks you can possibly do and it 's just part of his life . `` it 's no problems whatsoever . it 's not as serious as it looks . '' gomis has scored two league goals for swansea this season , mostly in a backup role . he became the welsh side 's top striker when wilfried bony signed with manchester city in january . almost exactly three years ago at white hart lane , then bolton midfielder fabrice muamba collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest . he was near death , according to bolton , but survived after being treated at the london chest hospital . he subsequently retired . other footballers , including cameroon international marc-vivien foe in 2003 and spanish international antonio puerta in 2007 , did n't survive after collapsing on the pitch .
<s> ruben navarrette : schilling deserves praise for taking on online haters for offensive comments about his daughter . </s> <s> navarrette : in protecting his child , schilling set a model for parenting and taught us a lesson about social media . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- my vote for father of the year goes to curt schilling . the former major league baseball pitcher recently fired off a series of fastballs and mowed down a group of twitter trolls who made the mistake of tweeting vulgar and sexually-explicit comments about schilling 's teenage daughter . the drama started , innocently enough , on february 25 , when schilling played the role of a proud father . he sent a tweet congratulating his daughter , gabby , on being accepted to salve regina university , where she 'll play softball . it read : `` congrats to gabby schilling who will pitch for the salve regina seahawks next year !! -- curt schilling -lrb- @gehrig38 -rrb- '' almost immediately , responses came in from young men , complete strangers who apparently followed schilling on twitter . the tweets quickly went from immature , to creepy , to repugnant . threats of rape were common . the tweets were deleted , and the accounts were closed after this story went viral . but not before schilling captured some of the images and posted them on his blog . what was said about 17-year-old gabby schilling was n't just obnoxious . it was vile and obscene . what was said was n't just mean and ugly . it was threatening and scary . as a parent , it 's the kind of thing that makes you rethink your opposition to public caning as a logical punishment for such transgressions . these misogynistic cowards may have thought they could hide in the darkness of anonymity , the sort that many have come to expect from social media sites , where you feel free to be a despicable human being because , you think , no one will ever find out who you really are and hold you accountable for your words . if so , they thought wrong . they could n't hide . they were found out , and they got the throttling they so richly deserved . thanks to dad . according to schilling , who made it his mission to track down these cretins and make sure those they associate with know who they really are , two people have already paid a price due to their tweets . one was a student disc jockey at a community college in new jersey , who was suspended , and the other was a part-time ticket seller for the new york yankees , who was fired . concerned that this is an example of exactly the kind of cyberbullying that leads some teenagers to commit suicide , schilling is also thinking about taking legal action against some of the other people involved . bravo for him . i 'm sure that , all across america , dads with daughters -- after reading some of the horrible things that were said about this young girl -- are marveling at schilling 's self-control . i have two daughters of my own , and he 's a better man than me . if ever there was a case where profanity-spewing malcontents deserved to have their mouths washed out with soap , this is it . so what additional insights can we draw , and what larger lessons can we learn , from this unexpected but predictable collision of old-fashioned parenthood and newfangled media ? there are a few . the first is about accountability , the very thing that the young men who posted these hurtful messages were trying to avoid . but schilling would n't let them . at their best , social media sites like twitter , facebook , instagram and others allow the sharing the information and the building of a sense of community . at their worst , they become digital sandboxes and locker rooms where people think have a license to misbehave without having to worry about consequences . we need to applaud efforts like this that promote greater online accountability . there 's also something to be said about protective parents , and how essential they are to a working society . we should still be concerned about those overprotective parents who hover like helicopters from little league to job interviews . we should n't bubblewrap our kids , and keep them from playing outdoors , and then sit around wondering why they 're soft , timid , and risk-averse . but protective parents -- the kind who shield their kids from real danger -- never go out of style . a parent 's top job is to protect his children . schilling did his job . finally , it 's worth reminding everyone that freedom of expression does not mean freedom from rules , standards , and expectations that should guide your behavior . there are things you do n't say . there are boundaries , ways that we expect you to behave so you do n't terrorize other people or bring shame upon yourself , your friends , and your family . if you do n't have social skills , you do n't belong on social media . the tweets make you wince . but in this story , you 'll still find plenty to smile about . this whole drama unfolded because schilling was proud of his daughter . now , given how he reacted , we all have reason to be proud of him .

'' cnn can not verify the authenticity of the page . but the power that multiplied broussard 's gift was data processing of genetic profiles from donor-recipient pairs . it works on a simple swapping principle but takes it to a much higher level , according to california pacific medical center in san francisco . so high , that it is taking five surgeons , a covey of physician assistants , nurses and anesthesiologists , and more than 40 support staff to perform surgeries on 12 people . they are extracting six kidneys from donors and implanting them into six recipients . `` the ages of the donors and recipients range from 26 to 70 and include three parent and child pairs , one sibling pair and one brother and sister-in-law pair , '' the medical center said in a statement . the chain of surgeries is to be wrapped up friday . in late march , the medical center is planning to hold a reception for all 12 patients . here 's how the super swap works , according to california pacific medical center . say , your brother needs a kidney to save his life , or at least get off of dialysis , and you 're willing to give him one of yours . but then it turns out that your kidney is not a match for him , and it 's certain his body would reject it . your brother can then get on a years-long waiting list for a kidney coming from an organ donor who died . maybe that will work out -- or not , and time could run out for him . alternatively , you and your brother could look for another recipient-living donor couple like yourselves -- say , two more siblings , where the donor 's kidney is n't suited for his sister , the recipient . but maybe your kidney is a match for his sister , and his kidney is a match for your brother . so , you 'd do a swap . that 's called a paired donation . it 's a bit of a surgical square dance , where four people cross over partners temporarily and everybody goes home smiling . but instead of a square dance , broussard 's generous move set off a chain reaction , like dominoes falling . her kidney , which was removed thursday , went to a recipient , who was paired with a donor . that donor 's kidney went to the next recipient , who was also paired with a donor , and so on . on friday , the last donor will give a kidney to someone who has been biding time on one of those deceased donor lists to complete the chain . such long-chain transplanting is rare . it 's been done before , california pacific medical center said in a statement , but matching up the people in the chain has been laborious and taken a long time . that changed when a computer programmer named david jacobs received a kidney transplant . he had been waiting on a deceased donor list , when a live donor came along -- someone nice enough to give away a kidney to a stranger . jacobs paid it forward with his programming skills , creating matchgrid , a program that genetically matches up donor pairs or chains quickly . `` when we did a five-way swap a few years ago , which was one of the largest , it took about three to four months . we did this in about three weeks , '' jacobs said . but this chain would n't have worked so quickly without broussard 's generosity -- or may not have worked at all . `` the significance of the altruistic donor is that it opens up possibilities for pairing compatible donors and recipients , '' said dr. steven katznelson . `` where there had been only three or four options , with the inclusion of the altruistic donor , we had 140 options to consider for matching donors and recipients . '' and that 's divine , broussard 's friend shirley williams wrote in a comment her on broussard 's facebook page . `` you are a true angel my friend . ''

'' weasels would not normally target green woodpeckers , pacheco said -- their predators are normally the size of a stoat or larger . but the birds are known to spend a fair amount of time on the ground pulling up worms and hunting insects . `` if the woodpecker had managed to hit the weasel with its beak it would have been the end of the weasel , '' she said . `` they 're quite gung-ho little creatures . '' the pluckiness of the weasel spawned a number of parodies on twitter , with manipulated images showing the creature in turn being ridden by russian president vladimir putin , popstar miley cyrus , football star john terry -- and even what appears to be a dog red panda dressed in a darth vader costume . -lrb- update : twitter has now educated us on the difference between a dog and a red panda . sorry , darth ! -rrb- . as for the bird ? the green woodpecker is also known as a `` yaffle '' for its laughing call . after the shock of being targeted by a hungry weasel wears off , we can only hope it lives up to its nickname .

'' a year later after the plane 's disappearance , not a single trace of flight mh370 has been found despite extensive search efforts . investigators believe the wreckage lies somewhere on the bottom of the indian ocean , based on the analysis of satellite communications data . the first sign that something was wrong with flight mh370 came after plane failed to check in with vietnamese air traffic controllers after leaving malaysian airspace . according to protocol , ho chi minh atc should have informed their kuala lumpur counterparts -lrb- kl atcc -rrb- about this within five minutes . instead they waited 20 . when ho chi minh finally did inform kuala lumpur , the confusion was evident , as seen in transcripts of the conversation released sunday . kl atcc asked three times at what point ho chi minh lost contact , then went on to express concern at the delay , asking `` why you did n't tell me first ? within five minutes you should be -lrb- sic -rrb- called me . '' the confusion only got worse after malaysia airlines mistakenly told kuala lumpur air traffic controllers they could see the flight somewhere over cambodia . it took an hour and a half to clear this up , after malaysia airlines admitted to controllers they were only looking at the projected flight track . malaysia airlines ceo ahmad jauhari yahya said the misinformation was a momentary lapse by a company employee . `` our information was only to be as a guide . we are not an atc per se . we do n't have radar , '' he told cnn . the watch supervisor then waited another two hours to activate the rescue coordination center . still another hour went by before before kuala lumpur issued the distress signal . no explanation for the delay is given in the interim report , which is composed of factual data and provides no conclusions or recommendations . after the air traffic controllers lost contact with mh370 , the plane continued to fly within the range of multiple radar systems belonging to four different countries . yet little seems to have been done with the data in the immediate hours after the plane disappeared . the interim report says that `` for unknown reasons '' indonesia 's medan radar did not see the flight . and thailand `` did not pay much attention , '' since mh370 's flight path did not fall within its borders . malaysian military radar tracked the flight for an additional hour , including its turn back across the malay peninsula . despite this information , search and rescue teams did not begin expanding the search area for a full day . though the interim report makes no mention of it , a failure by the malaysian military to alert others to the relevant radar data may be blame . a briefing document prepared by the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- said military authorities failed to share the final radar fix of mh370 with their civilian counterparts for 20 hours . cnn approached malaysia 's ministry of defence for comment but is yet to receive a response . another working document notes that mh370 's turn back might have been discovered much earlier , if the military and non-military agencies had coordinated better . `` in essence , a week or more was lost in the initial search because of poor civil/military cooperation , '' reads the icao working document . the interim report released by malaysian investigators on sunday provides no information about when the military radar data was shared with other authorities . it 's impossible to know if a speedier response from air traffic controllers , or more immediate access to radar data , would have changed the course of events for mh370 . but it would have provided authorities with more time , either to track the flight or to search the ocean before the batteries died in the emergency locator beacons . looking back at the series of miscommunication between air traffic controllers and the radar lapses also provides valuable lessons that could help future search and rescue operations . though the mh370 investigation team did not draw lessons in the current report , it plans to provide safety recommendations in the months ahead . journalist chan kok leong contributed to this report .

'' `` it was very tough . we have to be very careful and sensitive when we deal with a diplomat , '' ziauddin said , referring to the vienna convention , which affords diplomats certain degrees of consular immunity . he said the suspect , whom he identified as son young nam , the first secretary of north korea 's embassy in dhaka , initially refused to allow his baggage to be searched . `` he said there is no way we can open or scan his bag , '' ziauddin said . `` at first he said ` this is an electric motor . ' after further questioning he changed his mind and told us , ` these are cipher machines and very confidential . ' '' eventually , customs officers opened the diplomat 's bag and found the undeclared goods , that included 170 gold bars and golden ornaments . at current market prices , the gold would be valued at around $ 1 million . entering bangladesh without declaring this quantity of precious metal is a violation of the country 's customs regulations . an official with bangladesh 's foreign secretary , speaking to cnn on condition of anonymity , said his government lodged a protest with the north korean ambassador . it 's far too early to jump to conclusions about whether the alleged gold smuggling incident could be an isolated example of corruption or an effort to move official funds . due to international sanctions , north korea faces substantial obstacles when trying to access international banking systems . `` it would be interesting to see if -lsb- the diplomat -rsb- is disciplined when he gets back '' to north korea , said john delury , associate professor at yonsei university 's graduate school of international studies . `` that would be a way of saying whether or not he 's a corrupt diplomat .

<s> latest ferguson shootings push strained race relations to breaking point . </s> <s> donna brazile : relationship between police forces and minority communities must improve . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- with the ongoing protests over the shooting death by police of black teenager tony robinson in madison , wisconsin , the racist chanting of fraternity members at the university of oklahoma , and now the inexcusable shootings of two police officers in ferguson , missouri , it 's safe to say that the always-strained race relations in this country are being pushed to the breaking point . and the point with the most stress is the delicate relationship between police forces and the minority communities that they serve . to approach things from a more positive angle , the situation is dire enough that we absolutely have to try to uncover the good and not dwell on the negative . the best time to make things better is when it seems that everything is getting worse . this unacceptable status quo can motivate us to take the necessary steps to address the problems , which are not going to disappear unless we honestly deal with them . when things are going wrong , responsible people can begin by saying the right things . president obama said on twitter , `` violence against police is unacceptable . our prayers are with the officers in mo. . path to justice is one all of us must travel together . '' the congressional black caucus issued a statement saying , `` the cbc understands the frustrations in ferguson , but a response of violence is not the answer during this transformative moment in our country . '' and attorney general eric holder noted , `` this was not someone trying to bring healing to ferguson . ... this was a damn punk , a punk who was trying to sow discord . '' for the most part , authorities in missouri have been careful not to blame the peaceful protesters . surely , not all responses have been as measured , but the gravity of the situation will hopefully bring out the best in people . while we pause for a moment to let passions cool , we can use the time to consider how best to move forward with common resolve instead of mutual recrimination . the way forward is to engage citizens in the community -- to bring them into the room when decisions are being made about policing policies and procedures to make sure that those policies and procedures address the community 's real concerns . and it 's about putting law enforcement officers in the community as welcome members of that community -- as guarantors of the safety and security of the people instead of intimidating outside forces . this approach would benefit both the community and the police . i 'm certain that officers would rather be appreciated and valued by the people they serve than be pressured to fill city coffers by issuing unnecessary citations , as noted in the doj report on ferguson . nobody becomes a cop because they secretly long to be a collection agent . one of the easiest ways to integrate law enforcement officers into the community is to physically put them on the sidewalks by increasing the number of cops who work good old-fashioned foot beats . officers who view the world through a patrol car window are separated from the people they serve by more than a sheet of glass . being encased in a vehicle alienates a person from the world around them . the cop on the beat is not just a quaint notion from old movies , he can be a bridge between police forces and the people they serve . another idea is to give cops bicycles , which has brought so many law enforcement officials in touch with other cyclists in the community . lack of community policing is one of the shortcomings cited in the doj report on ferguson . in areas where the gulf between law enforcement and the neighborhood is too wide , mediators can be used to initially bring the two sides together . after all , both sides ultimately have the same goal of safe and peaceful neighborhoods . both police departments and members of the community can take proactive steps to come together on more than a purely professional level . a tech services company in the south bronx recently hosted a video game competition with police officers and residents of the neighborhood . the event left local teenagers saying things about the cops like `` basically they 're like us . '' ultimately , police should be considered members of the community -- a notion that needs to be encouraged by police departments and neighborhoods alike . communities can make the local cops part of their neighborhood celebrations . new orleans police det. winston harbin became a minor internet celebrity for his impromptu dancing with local people during mardi gras . besides just being fun , harbin 's interaction with the community helped foster the type of mutual appreciation and respect that are essential to effective community policing . fear and mistrust among minority communities toward police are the legacy of many decades of racism , unequal treatment , bias , subjective stereotyping and lack of opportunity . it is times like now , when that anger and resentment are boiling , that we address it . with the right approach , we can begin to change the attitude between the black community and the police from `` handsupdo n'tshoot '' to `` handstogetherintrust .

<s> a californian startup has developed a circular smartphone called `` runcible '' </s> <s> the provocative anti-phone is meant to be an antidote to our obsession for digital devices . </s><sec>-lrb- wired -rrb- screens are rectangles . even the 3-year-old playing with your ipad could tell you that . but what would the digital world look like through a different sort of frame ? say ... a circular one ? monohm , a startup based in berkeley , california , was founded around this very idea . for the last year , the three-person team has been working a circular , palm-sized device dubbed runcible . they cheekily refer to it as the `` anti-smartphone , '' a description that goes for both its form factor and its value system . the round device is meant to be the antidote to our feed-obsessed , notification-saturated digital existence . it 's a challenge to the rectangular status quo and everything it represents . that 's a quixotic dream , but an interesting one . display technologies have a long and rectangular history . before smartphones there were movie screens , tvs , and computers , not to mention paintings and pages of print . and then of course there are windows -- in some ways the original glass rectangles . in each case , the rectangle 's prominence can be attributed in large part to practicality . whether you 're talking about film or glass or stone , rectangles are easy to make . they do n't leave much wasted material . as frames for shaping the world , however , different types of rectangles can produce vastly different effects . 14 of the best architecture photos from the past year . in her book the virtual window , which traces the rectangular frame from renaissance painting up through microsoft windows , media theorist anne friedberg offers an example from the history of architecture , centering on a public feud between french builder august perret and the preeminent modernist architect le corbusier . perret was a strong advocate of the traditional french casement window , which was oriented vertically . its main function , he said , was to let light into a room . le corbusier , making use of new manufacturing techniques , designed his buildings around long , horizontal windows , which were as much about framing the outside world as illuminating the space within . the disagreement influenced architecture for decades to come . the simple act of turning a rectangle on its side gave us entirely new ways to think about space . rectangles are still subtly dictating our behavior today . movie screens , chased by tvs , have gotten bigger and wider , encouraging us to sit back and lose ourselves in the spectacle . -lrb- in 1930 , russian filmmaker sergei eisenstein lamented how the cinema 's `` passive horizontalism . '' he wanted the screen to be square . -rrb- . smartphones , with their slender , touch-controlled displays , have become a distinctly more active rectangle . paired with the never-ending vertical feeds that fill apps like facebook , instagram , and twitter , they 've become an irresistible , inexhaustible diversion . the point is this : frames matter . they suggest certain things about how we should approach them . they shape the type of stuff that 's made for them . and if just turning a rectangle on its side can make such a big difference , imagine all the interesting things that might happen if you left the rectangle behind altogether . runcible is n't meant to be a smartphone replacement so much as an alternative . `` i think we 've become really , really good at getting interrupted and creating conduits for interruption , '' says monohm ceo aubrey anderson , who met his co-founders during a stint at apple . `` it 's time now to use technology to get a little quieter . '' if miniaturizing the computer is what got us the smartphone , runcible asks what a gizmo might look like if you started by souping up a pocket watch . and the shape of the device is central to that thinking . a circular frame , after all , is no good for browsing a twitter feed . 12 most ancient and magnificent trees from around the world . so what is it good for ? that 's the question . at this point , runcible as much a provocation as an actual product . the three-person team , which has been working with the san francisco design studio box clever on the concept for nearly a year , has some prototype hardware and a crude sketch of an operating system , but they 've still got a long way to go . they 've got a few vague ideas for applications . one is a sort of dashboard that gives you an overview of activity on your social media accounts . another is a compass-style mapping system that encourages wandering instead of pure a-to-b efficiency . but they 're more enthusiastic about the philosophy behind it all : they want to see applications that distill information and streamline interaction , software that constrains the smartphone experience as it exists today . all this is easier said than done , of course . throwing out centuries of rectangular thinking and starting from scratch ai n't easy . plus , it 's not clear that people really want constraint to begin with . smartphones are distracting , sure , but they 're also incredibly useful and immensely entertaining and maybe a little distraction is a fair price to pay for all the good stuff . still , even as a hint of a possible device , runcible is compelling . for one thing , the company 's hardware model feels great in the hand -lrb- the team 's hardware guy , george arriola , came from sony , where he helped design the playstation 4 . -rrb- the model 's curved back brings to mind the very first iphone -- and makes you consider how each successive generation has become a little bit harder to hold . and though unformed , the vision for the software is interesting too . if today 's interactive rectangles and infinite feeds signal that there 's always more stuff just outside the frame , circles could offer something more self-contained , more complete . maybe even something actively inefficient . rectangles are beautiful and functional . circles are zen . a circular device would sever the link to the printed page , the tv and the computer , and invite developers to look elsewhere for metaphor and inspiration . pocket watches and compasses . microscopes and telescopes . peep holes , port holes , and wormholes . dials , buttons , and other circular controls . 15 incredible photos that 'll remind you to be awed by planet earth . if nothing else , the concept could be valuable simply for helping us identify some of the assumptions and habits that underlie our existing devices . maybe thinking about circles could help us make our rectangles better . runcible is just one scrappy , literal attempt to abandon the rectangle . but similar thinking is happening elsewhere . android wear , google 's smartwatch operating system , reconsiders what apps should look like on a tiny circular display . apple watch is in some ways another rectangle , but its real estate is limited enough that it will also encourage new , less rectangular thinking . -lrb- note how its home screen ditches iphone 's grid of icons for a blob of circular ones . also note the recent rise of circular avatars over the traditional square ones in apps and interfaces of all kinds -rrb- . we 've seen how sensors can be harnessed to choreograph experiences that happen outside of the frame entirely , as with disney 's magic bands , which usher you through the company 's parks . and then of course there are technologies like augmented reality and virtual reality , where your nose is effectively pressed so close to the glass that the frame disappears entirely . here , the screen is less of a window , more of a lens . the only frame is your field of vision . rectangles will endure . they 're easy , they 're efficient . but as new components and manufacturing techniques make it easier to experiment with other forms , we 'll likely find people exploring the unique effects they can produce . just recently , in fact , we saw an instance of a tech industry giant leaving the glass rectangle behind in a very big way . in a 10 minute video , google proposed a new headquarters that would leaves boxy buildings behind in favor of tent-like structures draped in glass . these buildings do n't have vertical windows or horizontal windows . they 're nothing but windows , or maybe they 're so radical that the concept of `` window '' does n't even really apply . whatever the case , there 's nothing rectangular about them , and google 's convinced they 're the future . read more from wired : . there 's a super-fast method for boarding planes , but airlines are n't using it . 21 awesomely well-designed products we 're dying to own . what cities would look like if lit only by the stars . subscribe to wired magazine for less than $ 1 an issue and get a free gift ! click here ! copyright 2011 wired.com .
<s> timothy stanley : gop senators ' letter to iranian leaders seems extraordinary . </s> <s> but undermining a president 's foreign policy is not at all unique , stanley says . </s> <s> he says both left , right have gone around administrations to deal with foreign leaders . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- the attempts by some in the gop to undermine president barack obama 's iranian policy certainly seem extraordinary . first , the republican leadership invited benjamin netanyahu to speak to congress without consulting the white house , and he duly warned against softening of the west 's line on iran . now , 47 senators have written an open letter to the iranian regime to advise that any deal agreed to with obama could be reversed after the 2016 presidential election . it is an astonishing move . but this is not , strictly speaking , unique . people in both parties have done far more remarkable things in the past . back in 1983 , sen. edward kennedy tried to set up a personal diplomatic channel with the soviet union -- effectively sidestepping president ronald reagan . working through proxies , he suggested that he visit moscow to meet with the communist leadership and offered to help them make their case to the american people as to why they preferred dialogue over confrontation . as washington post journalist vincent bzdek notes in his book `` the kennedy legacy , '' this occurred close to a u.s. presidential election , and some conservatives have interpreted it as an act of treason -- perhaps even a breach of the logan act , which forbids private citizens from engaging in diplomacy with the goal of changing foreign policy . one might argue that the senator was motivated by high ideals : he had a clear record of campaigning to reduce cold war tensions and thought reagan was mishandling the soviets . on more than one occasion , kennedy politicized foreign policy while in the senate . in my book on the 1980 democratic presidential primaries , i note that kennedy opposed jimmy carter 's hard-line stance on the soviet invasion of afghanistan -- a position that was well-intentioned , prophetic and somewhat advantageous to kennedy 's campaign for the democratic nomination . but it 's not only democrats who have done that . step forward , richard nixon . in 1968 , the presidential election looked close . with the johnson administration edging toward a peace deal in vietnam , nixon 's team rolled the dice . according to an account in politico , anna chennault , a republican activist , was given a message to pass onto the south vietnamese government : if they undermined the peace talks by being stubborn , the democrats would lose the election and nixon as the next president would offer them better terms . the south vietnamese indeed proved intransigent , and the republicans won the white house . no evidence exists directly tying nixon personally to the conspiracy , but we now know for sure that it happened and it 's far hard to imagine that it would have gone ahead without his knowledge . there is a view that it bordered on treason and -- again -- makes the 2015 gop efforts look tame by comparison . the extreme lengths that kennedy and nixon went to behind the scenes underlines the point that foreign policy has always been a deeply partisan matter that can often end in a challenge to executive authority . it 's true that the spirit of the constitution indicates that the country is expected to speak with one voice on foreign policy through the president . but such harmony has n't always been possible . recall that congress and the carter white house tore themselves apart over the panama canal treaties . that the reagan administration 's policy in nicaragua was so controversial that his staffers sent aid to the rebels through back channels , and the then-democratic house speaker , jim wright , was accused of presenting a private peace plan to the left-wing government . that bill clinton 's 1994 nuclear deal with north korea was criticized by both republicans and democrats . or that liberal democrats did their best to defund the iraq war . as damian paletta writes , foreign policy is generally conducted quietly by the white house through executive agreements that pass without comment . but the idea that foreign policy is beyond partisanship is naïve , and disagreements have gone public when the political conditions are appropriate . the particular matter of the iran talks is sensitive for the republicans because it involves the electoral holy trinity of obama , israel and the presidential primaries . they were n't going to walk away from this one , and we can hardly be surprised that they have n't . the democrats would do the same if the situation were reversed , as they have many times in the past . in a republic purposefully designed to have limited executive power , with a competitive two-party system bolted on to keep its politics fluid , this was arguably inevitable .

'' and `` grace and disgrace , '' much like aspiring jazz musicians listened to saxophonist john coltrane and amateur boxers studied tapes of sugar ray robinson -- for clues to greatness and inspiration . craddock elevated preaching to an art . he was often called a preaching genius . rather than deliver a sermon like a lecture -- an intro , three main points and a conclusion -- he developed an `` inductive '' conversational style of preaching . his sermons unfolded like a short story -- there was foreshadowing , plot twists , dialogue ; language of startling beauty and surprise endings . the way he ended his sermons was as memorable as what he said . he would abruptly stop , turn from the pulpit , and quietly sit as the audience sat in silence . people did n't applaud or shout hallelujah after his sermons . they were too busy absorbing what he had just said . the rev. barbara brown taylor , an author and world-renowned preacher , once said of craddock : `` he spoke of kierkegaard as easily as he spoke of the indianapolis 500 . he quoted kafka as helpfully as corinthians ... but he was also someone who noticed a lot about ordinary human life on earth . '' craddock , who taught preaching at the candler school of theology until his retirement , was selected as one of the 12 most effective preachers in the english-speaking world in a poll of 341 seminary professors and editors of religious periodicals in 1996 . i had a chance to meet craddock , as well as hear him . i spent several weeks with him in the autumn of 2011 to write a profile about his relationship with his father . he was just as impressive outside the pulpit . he would ease his rotund little body in a wooden chair and share touching stories about growing up poor in the small town of humboldt , tennessee , during the depression with an alcoholic father . he 'd talk about the infirmities of old age -- i remember saying with a chuckle that `` i should have something '' when referring to his bout with parkinson 's because he was getting old . he was funny , folksy , witty and his eyes danced with glee when he told a story . sitting in craddock 's presence was like listening to a wise uncle or grandmother . he had courtly , southern manners , and he gave the impression that he had all the time in the world for you . i never once heard him criticize anyone . it 's not uncommon to meet great people who , to borrow a phrase that craddock used , have `` domestic wreckage '' at home . but the craddock family was among his biggest fans . he was married to his high school sweetheart , nettie , for more than 50 years , and they had two children , laura and john . laura named her son after her father . and john , who became a ceo instead of a pastor , said his father was the most remarkable man he knew . `` i do n't care if it 's a guy on the street asking for a dollar or the president of the united states , he makes you feel as if you 're the most important person in the world when he 's talking to you , '' said john craddock . `` i won the lottery as far as great fathers go . '' over the years , i kept in contact with him . i 'd go to preaching workshops at his beloved craddock center , a non-profit ministry that served needy children in north georgia , tennessee and north carolina . the center provides books , hot meals , storytelling and music . perhaps craddock saw something of himself in the kids he helped . one thing is certain : he was n't content to preach compassion . he lived that message . craddock 's funeral will be held at 2 p.m. monday at cherry log christian church in blue ridge , georgia . people we 've lost in 2015 .

'' those were the words of tennis analyst mary joe fernandez in 2001 , early into serena williams ' decider with kim clijsters in the final of one of tennis ' most prestigious tournaments . the match was being televised on one of the biggest sports networks in the world , espn . the then 17-year-old clijsters had just held to love amid vociferous cheers and -- in a breach of tennis etiquette -- a large portion of the fans on center court at the event now known as the bnp paribas open roared approvingly when williams struck a double fault to begin the next game . despite williams growing up about 130 miles away in a suburb of los angeles , while clijsters hailed from belgium , there was clearly no home-court advantage . williams ' father , richard , and older sister , venus , were booed as they made their way to their seats prior to the finale , with richard claiming in usa today he was the victim of racial abuse . venus williams , meanwhile , said in a press conference at her next tournament she `` heard whatever he heard . '' it was richard williams who shaped his daughters into grand slam winners from a humble background , bereft of the type of money used to help manufacture many a champion . `` one guy said , ' i wish it was ' 75 , we 'd skin you alive , ' '' richard williams told usa today . `` i had trouble holding back tears . i think indian wells disgraced america . '' charlie pasarell , then the tournament director , said in the same story that he did n't discount richard williams was racially abused . cnn.com did not hear back from pasarell when it put in an interview request for him and clijsters declined an interview request . the fans ' reaction apparently stemmed from the sisters ' semifinal -- or lack of it . venus williams pulled out a mere minutes prior to the start , citing a knee injury . whispers of richard williams pre-determining the outcome grew , no doubt aided by the comments of elena dementieva . after venus williams beat dementieva in the quarterfinals , the russian said the sisters ' father would `` decide '' who won . serena williams , who was 19 back then , ultimately passed the ` test ' that day against clijsters , judging by the result : a three-set win . serena williams has certainly , too , shown her mental toughness over the years , adding 18 grand slam singles titles to the one she won prior to 2001 . but what transpired tarnished the tournament , the sport and hurt one of tennis ' all-time greats to such an extent that she stayed away from indian wells . until now . serena williams plays her first match in indian wells in 14 years on friday , saying she was `` following her heart '' in deciding to return . in the years that have passed since 2001 , williams went from teen to young adult to veteran , all the while collecting major titles elsewhere . `` it has been difficult for me to forget spending hours crying in the indian wells locker room after winning in 2001 , driving back to los angeles feeling as if i had lost the biggest game ever -- not a mere tennis game but a bigger fight for equality , '' serena williams told time.com in february . `` emotionally it seemed easier to stay away . `` there are some who say i should never go back . there are others who say i should 've returned years ago . i understand both perspectives very well and wrestled with them for a long time . `` i 'm just following my heart on this one . '' raymond moore , a former owner of the tournament and now its chief executive , was `` elated '' to have serena williams back in the field . `` in the past , the things that happened , there were no winners , '' moore told cnn.com . `` i think it was a terrible incident . regrettable from all sides . now , serena has been able to change that . we 're grateful , excited and happy and we 're going to welcome her with open arms . `` in terms of her reception , i would like her to be here feeling that her decision was received with the greatest and warmest reception possible . '' but serena williams will be the lone grand slam winner in her family attending . serena speaks about nerves before 1st match back at indian wells . even with the best efforts of the tournament -- now owned by billionaire larry ellison -- venus williams is continuing her boycott , as is richard williams , according to moore . the siblings ' mom , oracene price , will be alongside serena williams , though , added moore . serena williams told reporters in indian wells on thursday that her father , mother and venus williams gave her their blessing when she contemplated coming back to indian wells . `` we wanted to get venus , '' said moore . `` in fact we 'd like to welcome the whole family . but venus i think is not quite in the same place as serena is . and so we 've not been successful in enticing her to enter or take a wild card . `` but oracene is coming and so are some other family members . '' serena williams scoffed at suggestions that the sisters ' match in indian wells -- or any other between them -- was fixed . `` throughout my whole career , integrity has been everything to me , '' she told time . `` it is also everything and more to venus . the false allegations that our matches were fixed hurt , cut and ripped into us deeply . `` the under-current of racism was painful , confusing and unfair . in a game i loved with all my heart , at one of my most cherished tournaments , i suddenly felt unwelcome , alone and afraid . '' reflecting on the incident , bart mcguire , the chief executive of the women 's tour in 2001 , said venus williams had been suffering from a genuine injury and that the notion that richard williams dictated the outcome of matches between his daughters was off the mark . but he admitted things could have been handled better . venus williams , for example , might have explained her withdrawal to fans on court and then signed autographs , he said , citing the example of last year 's world tour finals . roger federer withdrew from the final in london -- but not before he addressed fans and signed autographs . what happened in the final between serena williams and clijsters was awful , said mcguire . `` i thought it was horrible , '' he told cnn.com . `` i thought it was very tough on the players . `` by that time i 'd known enough to know that venus had been significantly injured and that it was not a set-up of any kind . i thought it was unfair to serena and kim . '' serena williams is twice a champion at the tournament and winning this year would be `` fantastic , '' said moore . but even if not , he added : `` i think it 's a wonderful ending in closing an ugly chapter . we 're just looking forward , we 're not looking backward .

'' mom arrested for leaving 9-year-old alone at park . green , a journalist , lawyer and television legal analyst , says people often think of the law as scary and intimidating and believe they do n't need to worry about it because their kid is never going to get into legal trouble . whether it 's a case as serious as carter 's involuntary manslaughter charge , or a simple allegation of vandalism , parents need to be prepared , green said . `` i can not count the number of kids i know , good kids , who find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time , '' said green . `` i have now two young adults , and when they were going through their teenage years , it was a simple matter of a party that went wrong , a group of kids in the park when the police stop by and have some questions , bringing something to school they should n't have . `` and in each of those cases , a little bit of knowledge of the law , a little bit of knowledge of what their rights are , the right way to behave , would have saved parents a heck of a lot of grief . '' green thinks parents should think about the issue in the same way they would track down a good orthopedist if their child breaks a bone , or the best tutor if their child is struggling before the sat . parents ' house seized after son 's drug bust . `` i am not saying that parents need to go out and get their own law degrees ... but just dipping your finger into the topic will help you understand what 's available to you to help you parent better , '' she said . she gives some real-life examples especially in the social media age . for instance , what if a teen is asked by a school administrator to turn over his or her cell phone based on allegations the teen was sending inappropriate texts ? what parents should know , green said , is that a school ca n't open a cell phone for no reason at all . `` they need to have reasonable suspicion that something 's wrong , '' said green , who said parents would be wise to talk to their teens about what 's appropriate and what 's not when it comes to handling such requests from school officials . `` if you 're asked , as a child , for a locker search , to open a phone , to open a laptop , if it 's your property , pause and ask if you could call mom and dad , '' she said . `` we can act whether we 're lawyers or not as that first line of defense . '' green also says that parents of college-bound teens should spend a few minutes looking online at the school 's code of conduct . `` they do n't tell you about it during that fantastic tour with the kid walking backwards as your child is looking around to say , ` who can i party with ? ' but it 's a really important set of information because different schools have different levels of tolerance '' for activities such as drinking on campus , she said . and even before teens head off to college , parents should know about social host laws , where parents could be held criminally responsible or face civil damages if teens drink alcohol in their home and then go off and do something inappropriate or even tragic . scary consequences for parents hosting underage drinking . more than 150 cities or counties and 24 states currently have such laws on their books , according to mothers against drunk driving . in some cases , parents can be held liable even if they did n't know the drinking was taking place . `` it does n't have to be you with the shaker , like an episode of ` mad men , ' serving up manhattans to a group of grateful teens , '' said green . `` if you 've made it possible in your home , if you do n't lock your liquor cabinet -- i never did -- and all of a sudden kids are drinking , that could be a problem as well . '' while green is passionate about educating parents on why they need to think about the law , she stresses that bad behavior by teens still needs to be punished either legally or at home . `` i am not advocating that kids should be absolved of responsibility . if a kid does something wrong , if they broke the law , they ought to be punished appropriately by it . but we also live in a society where we have legal rights , and i want parents to know that they should be aware of what those are so they can help their child use better judgment . '' so if after reading this , you are moved to try to find a criminal defense lawyer , how on earth do you go about finding one ? green 's advice is to ask friends and colleagues for referrals and also consult with your state bar association , since you would want someone in your state who has experience with criminal defense issues . then she says you should call up and interview a few lawyers , asking them everything from how much their services would cost -lrb- that can vary -rrb- , to who would handle the work , to what their philosophy is about the law and teens ' rights . `` you may or may not end up being friends afterwards , but that 's not as important as feeling secure that your lawyer is approaching the situation in a way that feels right for you .

'' he promised , `` i will surprise again , and i will show my leadership and stamina . '' herzog began his political career in 2003 , when he first won a seat in the knesset with the labor party . he held a variety of ministerial positions , including minister of housing and construction , minister of tourism , and minister of welfare and social services , before becoming leader of the labor party in 2013 . in those elections , he also became the leader of the opposition , as benjamin netanyahu won another term as prime minister . but when netanyahu called for early elections in 2014 , herzog pegged his bid for the premiership on social reform . `` what i run for is social justice . i will change the nature of the division of wealth in a fair and more balanced way , close inequality and give a sense of purpose to the people here in the workplace , in the housing , and in the cost of living , '' promised herzog . before the election , the issue of a nuclear iran garnered international headlines as it further aggravated tense relations between the white house and netanyahu . herzog , in a speech almost immediately after netanyahu 's address to congress , promised to work with the united states and european powers , not against , to ensure the safety of israel . he echoed that sentiment in an interview with cnn 's elise labott . `` a nuclear-armed iran is dangerous to world peace , is dangerous to our region , is dangerous to israel . as leader of israel , i will never accept a nuclear-armed iran . never . and all options are on the table . '' in these elections , negotiations with the palestinians have n't been one of the major issues , but herzog promised to restart the stalled peace talks with the palestinian authority . `` i will do my best to ignite a political process with our palestinian neighbors . ... although i can not promise 100 % results , i promise 100 % effort . '' herzog comes from israeli political royalty . his grandfather , rabbi yitzhak halevi herzog , was the first chief rabbi of the state of israel . his father , chaim herzog , was an army general , an ambassador to the united nations and the president of israel . herzog believes it is his destiny to be the next prime minister of israel . `` what i carry with me is a unique legacy , a family legacy , but most important , an experience that brings me to be able to lead our nation .

<s> spanish photographer ignacio evangelista 's `` after schengen '' project captures images of abandoned european checkpoints . </s> <s> schengen agreement came into force 20 years ago , lifting border controls between participating european nations . </s> <s> border checkpoints range from giant soviet statements to small huts in deep , dark forests . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- thirty years ago , a journey across europe meant a passport full of stamps , a wallet full of different currencies and plenty of time spent waiting in line to be glared at by border officials . that all began to change in june 1985 , when the continent 's countries began signing up to the schengen agreement -- a deal that lifted frontier controls between cooperating neighbors . today , 20 years after it came into force , with more than 26 states now participating , schengen has completely altered the experience of traversing europe . nowhere is this more visible than at the old crossing points -- places that were once hives of activity but are now ghostly , vacated shells of their former selves . not entirely forgotten though . spanish photographer ignacio evangelista spent several years criss-crossing the continent to capture these abandoned checkpoints on camera for a project he calls `` after schengen . '' the result is a fascinating gallery of images that charts the unusual architecture of places whose fate has been intertwined with europe 's ever-evolving political and economic allegiances . `` i do n't know why but from many years ago , i feel very attracted to situations or places where the natural and the artificial come together , sometimes a little bit in conflict , '' evangelista tells cnn , explaining his interest in frontiers . he says he spent his formative years poring over the world atlas , marveling at the straight-line borders carved by colonialists across the map of africa and wondering why europeans could n't iron the kinks out of their own squiggled frontiers . `` when you are a young child in front of a map you feel ... you have the whole world in front of you and you can travel with your mind of course , with your imagination , '' he says . as a young adult in the early 1990s , evangelista experienced many of these borders firsthand when he embarked on an interailing trip -- a country-hopping rite of passage that sees many young europeans take advantage of cheap pan-continental train tickets . `` before , when i was young , if you traveled from spain to germany you had to cross three countries and take three currencies , '' he recalls . `` once i was traveling with my friend , interailing ... from italy to greece , we had to cross the old yugoslavia . `` i think into the night , 2 or 3 a.m. , we cross the border from italy into yugoslavia and the train stopped . we were sleeping , of course . then three or four soldiers come into the train and shouted at everybody , very aggressively , like in a spy movie . `` we waited half an hour , then half an hour later the train went on . it was exciting , even funny as i was 18 years old , but now it 's not so funny . '' as evangelista points out , in a europe cleaved by the cold war , many borders were not just the cultural dividing lines they are today . back then they were fortifications demarcating places of oppression and freedom . the checkpoints themselves were sometimes places of fear , of hostile bureaucracy -- a past evangelista says lingers on in the buildings left behind . `` for me it 's fascinating because you can see the passage of the time , the human footprint . `` these places had a very strong coercive role , people had to stop the car and the policeman had to ask you who you are , you showed your passport , maybe you had to open your bags . the police had the power to not let you go on . `` it 's interesting to me , looking at these places now they are a little bit spooky , because at most of them you can feel this ghostly atmosphere . '' the frontier buildings range in size and style , from giant soviet declarations of authority that loom over major highways to tiny huts in deep , dark forests . europe 's richer countries tend to maintain old posts , while less wealthier states seem content to let them deteriorate , evangelista says . some , he says , are gone completely , marked only on maps and located using gps trackers or by talking to locals . a strong supporter for an open europe at a time when some of the continent 's nations are talking about severing the close economic and political bonds they share with their neighbors , evangelista recalls one encounter that underscored the human side to his project . while setting up his camera at a checkpoint on the austria-hungary frontier , he watched as a man drove in from the austrian side and parked , followed by a woman , two minutes later , from the hungarian side . `` they began to speak and they were kissing very much . after 10 minutes they went back their separate ways , and i thought , before the schengen agreement , this couple had no future .

<s> religion professor candida moss appears in each episode of the program . </s> <s> moss was part of the original study to determine if relics found in bulgaria could be the bones of john the baptist . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- i 'm candida moss and i am professor of new testament and early christianity at the university of notre dame . i was an adviser on the `` true cross '' episode and served as one of the many on-camera experts in cnn 's `` finding jesus '' series , which currently airs on sundays . viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the `` finding jesus '' facebook page during the show . below are some of the more interesting questions and my answers to them . my apologies to everyone i did n't get to . feel free to tweet your questions to me directly . herb scribner : can anyone explain to me what the bible 's deal is with 40 days/nights ? moss : it 's more an interest in the number 40 . in the hebrew bible the people of israel wander in the wilderness for 40 years before they reach the holy land . the flood lasts for 40 days and nights ; moses spends 40 days and nights on the mountain ; goliath spends 40 days encouraging the israelites to challenge him before david steps up ; 40 is a common age for people to be when they get married ; in the book of judges it is always 40 years between judges ; and david and solomon each reigned for 40 years . what we can take away from all of this is that people in the ancient world saw 40 as suggesting a full , complete period of time . it 's sort of like a narrative stock number , in the way that modern jokes follow the rule of three . yalanda m. price : was there any division between the followers of jesus and the followers of john the baptist ? moss : one of the interesting things about the relationship between jesus and john the baptist is that john does n't lay down his tools and follow jesus after he baptizes him . nor , it seems , did john 's disciples . they had separate ministries and , while there may have been contact between the two groups , they were also de facto competitors in the ancient religious marketplace . there are some hints in the new testament that jesus and his followers had to differentiate themselves from john by stating that jesus ' baptism was better -lrb- acts 11:6 -rrb- and countering the idea that jesus was actually john raised from the dead -lrb- matthew 14:2 -rrb- some scholars argue that these references are evidence of tension between followers of jesus and followers of john . mark goodacre answers your questions about the shroud of turin . jeffery graff : can the dna tests on the bones indicate whether he is a jew or even whether he is of the tribe of levi ? moss : i 'm so glad someone brought up dna . the dna tests on the bulgarian bones yielded only mitochondrial dna -lrb- dna passed down by the mother -rrb- , not the more reliable nuclear dna -lrb- the kind of dna referred to in forensic investigations -rrb- . in the original study of the bulgarian relics -lrb- of which i was a part -rrb- the mitochondrial dna revealed that the bulgarian relics were of `` probable semitic origin . '' thinking back to my time in the laboratory with the copenhagen scientists , i recall that the lead investigator estimated that the probability was about 75 % . the episode last night stated things a little too sharply when it said that the bones were from a middle-eastern man . as for the more specific question about the genetics of jews and members of the tribe of levi : current scientific technology does not reveal this kind of information even if start-up genetic testing companies promise this kind of information . cyndi rosenthal : are there any other historical references of john the baptist outside of the bible ? daniel josé camacho : any extra-biblical sources that shed light on historical figure of john the baptist ? moss : -lrb- these questions are on a similar topic , so i 've chosen to answer them together . -rrb- actually there is external attestation for the life and importance of john the baptist . this is important because it 's fairly rare to find this kind of evidence for ancient figures outside the writings of their followers . the jewish historian josephus mentions john the baptist in his book , `` the jewish antiquities . '' josephus describes john as a `` good man '' who possessed `` virtue '' and had `` great influence '' over the people . according to josephus , herod put john the baptist to death because he was afraid that he might raise a rebellion . this gives us another -- arguably more historical -- perspective on why john was executed and provides further evidence about just how important john was in his own day . watch the latest full episode anytime on cnngo . daniel josé camacho : wait , how did jesus get `` our father '' prayer from johnny b ??? did n't catch that . moss : i 'm also really glad someone brought this up , because i wondered about it too . in the gospel of luke , one of jesus ' disciples says , `` lord , teach us to pray , as john taught his disciples . '' it 's an interesting request that tells us something about john the baptist 's ministry and the demanding characters of jesus ' disciples ! in luke , jesus responds to this request by teaching them the lord 's prayer . we do n't know that the lord 's prayer came from john , and personally i do n't think it did ; i think this is just how luke shaped his version of events . but if you were just reading luke you could come to that conclusion .

'' tab and entering the name of the football ground , positioning of the offender , and incident details . although contact details of the person reporting the incident are requested , kio emphasized that the anonymity of the tool is key . every single objection logged by fans , either on the phone , via email , or on the app , triggers an investigation by the english football association -lrb- fa -rrb- . these include 73 incidents on social media -lrb- a 24 % increase -rrb- , which have so far led to 21 instances of the offender being identified , and at times having their accounts deleted . the fa , which released its own witness complaint guidelines in 2013 , encouraged fans to be proactive in flagging up incidents . `` reporting abuse , whether witnessed or experienced , is an important part of the game 's overall anti-discrimination work , '' said an fa spokesperson . `` there are clear ways for players and fans to do this , and these improved procedures should result in more reports in the future . '' bates admitted that it takes `` bravery and courage '' for fans to record photographic evidence on their phones , but pointed to the effect british expatriate paul nolan has had after he filmed chelsea fans physically stopping a black man from getting on the paris metro last month . the amateur video obtained by the guardian newspaper , and posted on its website , shows the man make multiple attempts to board a train at richelieu-drouot station , only to be pushed away each time by a group of passengers . the chelsea fans can then be heard chanting : `` we 're racist , we 're racist and that 's the way we like it . '' chelsea were in france to play paris saint-germain in a champions league first-leg tie - europe 's premier football tournament -- which finished 1-1 . five people have been identified and suspended by chelsea , who have launched an ongoing investigation . later in february , kio says it contacted the police over social media footage which showed men , thought to be west ham fans , singing anti-semitic songs on a train while traveling to tottenham hotspur 's white hart lane ground ahead of an english premier league game . `` would we know that these paris and london incidents had happened if they were n't on video ? '' bates asks , adding that kio is considering an option to upload video and still images of offenders directly to a complaint log on the app . `` if you have video footage and you can issue that retrospectively , it can make it easier to identify the perpetrators , '' he says . in a report released in 2013 entitled `` english football 's inclusion and anti-discrimination action plan '' , the fa explicitly talks about `` raising confidence in the reporting and disciplinary process at grassroots level . '' kio 's jurisdiction extends to all of english football , including the amateur ranks . it is one of the few independent bodies in world sports which solicits complaints from fans in order to weed out abusive behavior . it also polices the actions of players , which has embroiled the organization in controversy of its own in the past . in 2012 , rio ferdinand refused to wear a kio t-shirt before a match while playing for manchester united . he was protesting a perceived lack of response by the governing bodies against john terry after the chelsea defender was accused of racially abusing his brother , anton ferdinand of queens park rangers . terry was banned for four matches and fined # 220,000 by the fa for his actions .

'' but we 're unlikely to hear much about how people will actually use this new product for some time . our research has found that smartwatches certainly do have some benefits for users . but they also have a hidden , darker side which the companies selling them are unlikely to talk about . as part of a research project with alberto rizzoli , we have tried to understand what drives people to invest in smartwatches . one participant , a judge , hoped he could keep track of the deluge of emails during long hours in the courtroom when he had to pay attention -- and be seen to pay attention . the dilemma is familiar to many of us . we spend our days engaged in social interaction . huge proportions of our time are taken up with meetings or impromptu encounters with colleagues . however when we are in these meetings , our smartphone is buzzing away reminding us that our inbox is filling up . we may want to check these incoming messages , but know it would be rude to glance at our phone . when one of the first smartwatches came to market , the judge thought he had found the solution to this problem . we found that heavy smartwatch users valued how the devices helped them track information as it arrived while still appearing socially attentive . it also saved users the hassle of having to dig through their pockets or handbags to find a buzzing phone . surprisingly only about half the people we spoke with actually used all the health tracking technology built in to the watches . they were more interested in keeping abreast of their inbox than their calorie count . we also noticed a worrying side to these new devices as heavy users of the watches incorporate them into their daily routines -- we call it the `` phantom device effect . '' they would compulsive check their watch not just for the time , but for a wide range of information . in some cases their new gizmo would become such an instinctive part of their life that even when not wearing one they would check their bare wrist . some would feel a phantom buzz , notifying them of an imaginary incoming email . the phantom device effect leads us to ask about just how ingrained in our daily habits these devices might become . recent research has suggested that average smartphone users check their phone 150 times a day , starting just minutes after waking up . we also know this has the effect of extending work into all areas of our lives -- monitoring work emails late into the night or during social or family events . we used to worry that the average american watched television for six hours a day . now we accept as a matter of course the fact that we tied to our devices for most of the time we 're awake . indeed many of us go to bed with our smart devices quietly monitoring our rhythms as we sleep . this raises the question of what impact it will have on our lives . in the work carl cederström and i have done on the hidden dangers of wearables , a big big concern is privacy . the apple watch , like most wearables , is essentially a tracking device , recording heart rate , sleep patterns , movement , whereabouts , and much more depending on the apps installed . all this is packaged and transmitted to datacentres for analysis . the result ? a database of personal information of which the stasi could only have dreamed . as well as sucking up personal information , wearables could fuel an unhealthy obsession with personal wellness . by pumping health and wellbeing information at us non-stop , we start to become a little too focused on our bio-rhythms . data which would have been generated only in the most unusual situations now becomes commonplace , making people not just health conscious , but also self-obsessed . instead of checking in with social networks , we spend more time checking in with our own bodily rhythms . as a result other people start to become more interested in what is going on inside themselves rather than what is happening in the world . as we pay more attention to our feed of personal biodata we 're likely to become more anxious about things that we may never have given a second thought to in the past . not walking your allotted steps in a day or finding you had a poor sleeping pattern at night can become a source of significant personal guilt or worry . as a result , we pour more attention into monitoring and controlling ourselves , giving us less time to do the things which actually make us happy . if apple 's projections are indeed correct and tens of millions of people purchase smartwatches , it 's likely to create a step change in our lives . we already see people routinely posting on social media information they would have only shared with their doctor a few years ago . widespread use of smartwatches could mean that instead of relieving our boredom by answering emails , people will spend their time sifting through their biodata stream , planning ways to maximize their personal wellness ratings . rather than talking about what was on television last night , people will start comparing charts of their sleeping patterns . when this happens we will know that the internet of me has arrived . read : will your apple watch program you ? copyright 2015 the conversation . some rights reserved .

'' after receiving an anonymous complaint of elder abuse about lee , the state of alabama sent investigators from the alabama securities commission to talk to her and others around her . `` it was clear to our investigators that she fully understood the questions that were being asked , that she indicated she certainly wanted her book published , and she had her opinions that were voiced during the interview , '' joseph borg , the agency 's director , told cnn . `` and at that point we decided that she certainly knew what was going on . '' lee wrote `` go set a watchman '' before `` to kill a mockingbird , '' and it features some of the same characters . lee lawyer tonja b. carter found the `` go set a watchman '' draft in the author 's belongings in august and negotiated a publishing deal with harpercollins . for now , `` go set a watchman '' is still scheduled to be released by harpercollins in july . the securities commission investigation is closed . `` should something come up a later date that shows something was wrong , which we have no indication of , we could take another look , '' borg said . `` but since we had no complaint from the person who in the middle of it all , so there was no reason to maintain the case open .

'' `` the only way to truly know is by having access to secretary clinton 's personal server , '' the indiana republican added . `` we are asking secretary clinton to turn her server over to a neutral , third-party arbiter . after a complete inventory , this arbiter can make a determination as to which emails should be public and which should remain private . these decisions would be completely impartial and independent . '' so far , brooks ' committee had gotten just under 300 of clinton 's emails from the state department . last year , as it was trying to update its records , the state department asked former secretaries of state for nonpersonal emails from their personal accounts that could be work-related . that request prompted clinton to turn over 30,490 emails -- about 55,000 pages . clinton has asked for those emails to be made public , and department officials are reviewing them to make sure no sensitive information is released . clinton 's office had said her account contained 62,320 sent and received emails from march 2009 to february 2013 . `` about half were personal that were not in any way related to work . i had no reason to save them , '' clinton said at her press conference . the fact that all emails from senior officials were n't automatically saved until recently does n't mean they are gone , according to the state department . `` i would n't state it 's lost to history , because there are always -- there are technical means of gaining access to past information , '' spokeswoman jen psaki said friday . at the same time , psaki said the state department chose to change its approach -- by automatically saving all emails -- `` because it 's an imperfect system . '' `` this is a more efficient and better way , '' she said of the new system . `` but , obviously , there were ways to preserve -lrb- emails -rrb- , and employees and individuals were expected to do that prior to this new process . '' separately , psaki said that a letter was recently sent to former state department staffers asking for their help in the preservation effort . `` if they should become aware ... of federal record in their possession -- such as an email sent or received on a personal email account while -lrb- they were -rrb- serving in their official capacity at the department -- that ... record -lrb- should -rrb- be made available to the department , '' psaki said the ex-staffers were told . even before last month 's chance , emails of current secretary of state john kerry , who uses a government address , were already being saved automatically . cnn 's adam levine contributed to this report .

'' the decline may be due to a number of factors , including the rebounding economy , law enforcement action and leadership issues within the groups , the splc said . the `` high social '' cost of being associated publicly with a hate group is also noted as a factor for decline , the group said . `` the atmosphere has changed , '' mark potok , editor-in-chief of the `` intelligence report , '' told reporters on a conference call . `` overall , the groups are less important . '' people publishing messages of hate directly to the internet is also cited as a possible reason for the decline in the organized groups . california and florida have the largest number of hate groups , with more than 50 each . alaska and hawaii are the only states with no hate groups , according to the splc . the report tracks the number of chapters or groups , not individual members , so while the number of groups is on the decline , it 's possible that some of the groups that remain have increased membership . the ku klux klan experienced the largest decline of all hate groups , according to the report , losing more than 50 % of its chapters . one of the oldest and most infamous hate groups in the united states , the kkk took its foothold after the civil war , terrorizing the african-american population with intimidation and violent actions , including lynching . the klan 's growth slowed after the establishment of jim crow laws in the american south , according to the splc . the kkk 's last resurgence came during the civil rights movement of the 1960s . the group was again responsible for large-scale terror against the south 's african-american population . in 1990 , the splc started to keep track of the number of kkk chapters , which reached a high of 221 in 2010 , in response to president barack obama 's election , according to the report . since then , the numbers have been on the decline . the splc now reports 72 chapters , down from 163 a year ago . under obama , 4 in 10 say race relations worsened . the reason for the decline of the ku klux klan is not totally clear , though the report even suggests the groups may be going deeper underground . `` it appears that most of the groups simply faded as their leaders and members got older , but it is also very possible that many simply stopped announcing where their chapters were , '' the report said . the center estimates that between 5,000 and 8,000 people are klan members in the united states . opinion : america facing anti-muslim bigotry . the splc report also notes that more people may be operating as so-called lone wolves . the overall number of hate groups peaked in 2011 and has been on the decline since . however , the number of registered users to stormfront -- a website claiming to be `` the voice of the new , embattled white minority ! '' -- has doubled since 2008 . it now has nearly 300,000 users . lone wolves are a concern , the report said , because 90 % of all domestic terror attacks since 2009 were carried out by individuals or pairs . lone wolf planned attack on u.s. capitol , fbi says . the report points to neo-nazi frazier glenn miller , who allegedly killed three people in kansas who he thought were jewish , and an incident in las vegas , where an anti-government couple killed two police officers before being killed themselves , as examples of radical criminal elements acting alone . the splc refers to this and other indicators to say that many individuals may be moving from organized groups to the internet , to become more anonymous . looking towards next year , splc is `` expecting a real wave of islamophobia '' because of the proliferation of isis and the heavy media coverage of the extremist group , potok told reporters .

'' a tow truck took it away in 2009 . so began an odyssey with ferguson police , municipal court and city hall that left her with $ 1,200 in fines that to this day she still does n't fully understand . she paid the sum because endless court hearings about the car wore her down . `` i do n't have a lawyer . i 'm not a lawyer . it 's me going up against the city of ferguson when the attorneys wo n't help , '' hoskin said this week . she never saw again her 1996 oldsmobile ninety-eight with 168,000 miles . its location is a mystery . she accepts the loss because at least she 's not in jail , where city authorities threatened to put her at one point , she said . while hoskin 's surrender of both car and $ 1,200 to the city may seem a matter of personal choice , the u.s. justice department revealed this week a `` pattern and practice '' of racial discrimination within ferguson that may lend credibility to hoskin 's account of a government run amok . just about every branch of ferguson government -- police , municipal court , city hall -- participated in `` unlawful '' targeting of african-american residents such as hoskin for tickets and fines , the justice department concluded this week . the millions of dollars in fines and fees paid by black residents served an ultimate goal of satisfying `` revenue rather than public safety needs , '' the justice department found . to the outside world , the federal findings were staggering , but to hoskin and other longtime residents , the conclusion was nothing new . they 've felt it all along , they say . it 's only now that federal authorities have documented the institutionalized racism , as part of a civil rights investigation after a white police officer 's fatal shooting of an unarmed black teen , michael brown , 19 , last summer . the officer , darren wilson , was cleared of federal civil rights violations this week and was earlier cleared of criminal wrongdoing . the justice department is expected to pursue a court-supervised consent decree that requires the city of ferguson to make changes to its police and courts . `` it 's definitely a vicious cycle , '' said hoskin , 64 , a retired airline reservation agent . `` unfortunately for most people who are in this cycle , they continue to be in a downward spiral because they ca n't get jobs , they ca n't do anything , they ca n't pay the fines . '' hoskin 's household has experienced its share of ugly encounters with ferguson police , the family said . hoskin 's daughter was ticketed by police in what she described as racial profiling , she said . in 2007 , kimberly hoskin got a $ 124 ticket for driving her sister 's car , which was n't insured in missouri , and then had to pay an additional $ 100 fine when she missed a court appearance because of an emergency appendectomy . the court , she said , rejected her medical excuse and issued a warrant for her arrest . she paid a total of $ 224 in fines because she was in the middle of a job search and did n't want an outstanding warrant to prevent her from getting a good job . `` why is it that all the people in court are black ? '' kimberly hoskin said of defendants in municipal court . `` i 've had so many police officers make a u-turn , follow me , run my plates , find out everything is ok , then turn around and go back in the direction they were going . `` there 's nothing we can do . in ferguson , the police do what they want to do . ferguson does what it wants , '' said kimberly hoskin , 35 , who now works the overnight shift on a general motors manufacturing line . city officials and police declined to respond to cnn 's requests this week for comment about the hoskin family 's assertions . last september , the city council repealed administrative fees imposed by police when overseeing the release of a towed vehicle , the mayor said . the city also no longer has a specific offense for failing to appear in court , which eliminates certain additional fees and court costs , the mayor said . the justice department 's report details how ferguson operated a vertically integrated system -- from street cop to court clerk to judge to city administration to city council -- to raise revenue for the city budget through increased ticketing and fining . ferguson 's budget increases were so sizable that city officials exhorted police and court staff to levy more and more fines and tickets against violators , who turned out to be largely african-american , the justice department said . the demands for revenue were so intense that the police department had `` little concern with how officers do this , '' even disciplining officers who failed to issue an average of 28 tickets a month , the justice department report said . officers competed `` to see who could issue the largest number of citations during a single stop , '' the justice department said . one apparent winner was an officer who issued 14 tickets at a single encounter , according to the federal investigation report . many police stops of civilians `` have little relation to public safety and a questionable basis in law , '' the report said . ferguson police chief mum on federal report . indeed , ferguson enjoyed so much success in issuing tickets and fines that ferguson , population 21,000 , was ranked in the top eight of the 80 municipal courts in st. louis county by having more than $ 1 million in revenue in 2010 , the report said . when ferguson court revenues exceeded $ 2 million in 2012 , the city manager responded to the police chief in an internal email : `` awesome ! thanks ! '' according to the federal report . even municipal judges were pressured to boost revenue . `` the city has made clear to the police chief and the municipal judge that revenue generation must also be a priority in court operations , '' the federal investigation found . the city finance director said in a 2011 report that the municipal judge had been successful since 2003 in increasing court collections , and that internal 2011 city report noted a judge 's statement that `` none of these changes could have taken place without the cooperation of the court clerk , the chief of police , and the prosecutor 's office , '' the justice department investigation found . cash filled the city treasury . by 2013 , revenue from enforcing municipal codes reached $ 2.46 million , the federal report said . by 2015 , the city anticipated that fines and fees would account for 23 % of the budget , or $ 3.09 million of $ 13.26 million in general fund expenses , the justice department found . just five years earlier , court fines and fees made up only 12 % of the budget , or $ 1.38 million of $ 11.07 million in general fund revenues , the justice department found . the fines were among the highest of surrounding municipalities . for example , area parking fines ranged from $ 5 to $ 100 , but ferguson 's parking fine was $ 102 . a fine for `` weeds/tall grass '' was $ 5 in one nearby city , but ferguson 's fine ranged from $ 77 to $ 102 , the justice department found . the federal government made a forceful conclusion : . `` city , police and court officials for years have worked in concert to maximize revenue at every stage of the enforcement process , beginning with how fines and fine enforcement processes are established , '' the federal report said . after the justice department 's announcement this week , ferguson mayor james knowles told reporters that he , police chief tom jackson and city attorney stephanie karr met with federal officials about their findings and initiated several initiatives , including reforms to the municipal court . knowles said municipal judges have created a docket for alleged offenders having trouble paying fines . also , a defendant may ask a judge or prosecutor about different payment plans or alternative sentencing , the mayor said . defendants have been required to pay an entire fine at once , regardless of ability to pay , the federal report said . the city also passed an ordinance last september to cap municipal court revenues at 15 % of the city 's overall budget , the mayor said . that figure is half missouri 's legal limit , he added . all the reforms are intended to `` move this city , its residents and our entire community forward , '' the mayor said . back at her home , loistine hoskin recalled the height of absurdity in her fight against the city , which occurred shortly after her husband , calvin , died in 2008 of complications from paralysis he suffered in a car accident three years earlier . she had been his caregiver . she appeared in court to appeal the citation , but an officer arrested her and put her in the back of the squad car . her offense ? failing to appear in court , she said . she spent four hours in jail . she insists she made every court date . for now , she lives in fear of the police , even at home . `` we just got to a point where we said we 're just not going to have anyone over -- because they were fearful when they left they would get some ticket , and they did n't even live here , '' hoskin said . cnn 's ed lavandera and tristan smith contributed from ferguson . michael martinez reported and wrote this story from los angeles .

<s> david wheeler : silicon valley does n't create jobs ; it 's wiping out middle-class jobs . </s> <s> young college graduates are struggling with lack of jobs , yet many still idolize silicon valley . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- we have no problem taking wall street executives to task for decisions that leave american families financially devastated , yet we give silicon valley billionaires a pass when they do the same thing . america needs to realize that instead of creating jobs , silicon valley is erasing them , leaving millennials financially stranded before their careers can get off the ground . silicon valley is tossing millennials aside like yesterday 's laptop . the commonly held belief is that with hard work and a good education , a young person in america can get a good job . but despite falling unemployment , college grads age 22 to 27 are stuck in low-paying jobs that do n't even require a college degree . the percentage of young people languishing in low-skill , low-paying jobs is 44 % , a 20-year high . only 36 % of college grads have jobs that pay at least $ 45,000 , a sharp decline from the 1990s , after adjusting for inflation . perhaps most depressingly , the percentage of young people making below $ 25,000 has topped 20 % , worse than in 1990 . in other words , those with a bachelor 's diploma were better off before the digital revolution . if this comes as a surprise , that 's because images from popular culture push the idea that young college graduates are shrugging off bad employment prospects with their do-it-yourself attitude . in our collective imagination , millennials are saying , `` no jobs ? that 's ok -- i 'll create my own ! '' and then they solve their own problems by heading to silicon valley with little more than an iphone and an idea to create the next hip app that supposedly will turn them into overnight millionaires . a fictional example of this new breed of young idealistic entrepreneur would be mike bean , founder of internet behemoth gryzzl on the show `` parks and recreation . '' played by blake anderson , bean might best be described as `` barefoot and pregnant with ideas . '' the bumbling entrepreneur conquers the world practically by accident , armed only with his digital savvy , a can-do spirit , and a penchant for invading users ' privacy . you get the idea that his success came easily . privacy concerns aside , the mike beans of america are just about as rare as the mark zuckerbergs . in fact , the percentage of people under 30 who own private businesses has reached a 24-year low . garages across the country are not exactly humming with millennials launching tech startups . but wait -- wo n't the digital economy eventually lead to better jobs ? after a period of adjustment , wo n't things get better ? unfortunately that 's not the path we 're on . one of the biggest misconceptions about the digital economy is that for every middle-class job rendered obsolete by technology , there 's a new , equally good -lrb- or better -rrb- job created by silicon valley . but exactly the opposite is happening . the digital economy is vaporizing the good jobs and replacing them with two kinds of jobs : minimum wage jobs -lrb- think amazon warehouse employees -rrb- and so-called `` sharing-economy jobs '' -lrb- think uber drivers -rrb- . the sharing-economy jobs are even worse than minimum wage jobs because they offer no stability or protections for workers . sharing economy jobs are n't really jobs at all ; they 're freelance gigs . sure , silicon valley does n't owe america jobs . but something is wrong with the picture of a handful of tech billionaires overseeing a kingdom of falling wages , decreased worker protection and zero job security . this `` winner-take-all '' digital economy is not sustainable . people on both sides of the political spectrum are worried . liberal luminary robert reich , a professor at the university of california at berkeley and former secretary of labor under bill clinton , calls the sharing economy the `` share-the-scraps '' economy . speaking of tech companies that utilize on-demand labor , such as uber , instacart and taskrabbit , he says , `` the big money goes to the corporations that own the software . the scraps go to the on-demand workers . '' meanwhile , conservative columnist ross douthat fears a dystopian future in which `` a rich , technologically proficient society will no longer offer meaningful occupation to many people of ordinary talents . '' put simply , silicon valley 's utopia is the rest of america 's dystopia . and those who are punished more than anyone else are recent college graduates , whose lifetime earning potential has already suffered an irreversible setback . and if you think your own job is safe , think again . new research predicts that nearly half of all jobs are susceptible to automation over the next two decades . this is a giant leap backward , but it 's deceptively described as technological `` progress . '' as anyone who 's talked to an automated system on the phone lately can attest , `` automated '' usually means `` worse . '' what can be done ? how can we fight this slide back toward the middle ages ? if we take no action , we 're headed toward a kind of digital world feudalism where there are a handful of kings , a lot of peasants and no middle class . there 's no easy fix , but we can do three things immediately . first , we can stop glorifying tech titans and start talking openly about silicon valley 's questionable tactics and its real job creation record -lrb- i.e. , just follow the numbers -rrb- . second , we can encourage more lawsuits against the abusive practices of `` sharing-economy '' powerhouses . third , we can elect leaders who are vocal about holding silicon valley accountable for their power over the entire american workforce , including white-collar employees . the fictional gryzzl 's tagline borrows some millennial slang : `` would n't it be tight if everyone was chill to each other ? '' indeed it would . and if we want a better future for millennials and the generations after them , we need to challenge the prevailing silicon valley ethos before it 's too late .

' i believe it was justice for him to score he worked extremely hard today , ' arsenal manager arsene wenger said of welbeck . his counterpart van gaal will now , barring a miracle , be left without a trophy in his first season in charge of the english powerhouses , with the pressure now on to seal a top four place in the epl to guarantee champions league football next season .

'' the first tie ended 1-1 in paris three weeks ago but most of the headlines related to an ugly incident of racism on the city 's metro system . a group of supporters , apparently chelsea fans , were caught on camera appearing to prevent a black man from boarding a train before chanting : `` we 're racist and that 's the way we like it . '' the uk 's metropolitan police announced on wednesday that it had summoned five men to appear in court later in march , while chelsea has vowed to ban for life any of its fans that are found guilty . the club extended an invitation to the man who was the the subject of the abuse , known as souleymane s , but the 33-year-old refused . the opening stages were tense and feisty , just as they were in the french capital during the first leg , but the match in london ignited after a flashpoint just past the half hour mark . ibrahimovic , so often the hero for psg , turned villain after being dismissed for a forceful tackle on chelsea 's brazilian playmaker oscar . the home side surrounded referee bjorn kuipers who duly produced a red card -- the fourth of the swede 's often controversial career in the champions league . but replays suggested the 33-year-old was perhaps unfortunate to see red , having tried to pull out of the tackle at the last second . despite having a man advantage , chelsea struggled to create clear cut openings as psg defended resolutely . kuipers was in the spotlight again as the half came to a close -- a mazy run from striker diego costa ended when he was felled by psg 's uruguayan forward edinson cavani . the referee took a long look at the incident but decided to wave play on , much to the chagrin of chelsea 's players and manager jose mourinho . mourinho 's travails continued after the break as the blues toiled in its attempts to open up a determined psg rearguard . a half chance for gary cahill came and went before the visitors came to the fore . first cavani played in maxwell , whose ball across the face of goal was begging to be tapped in , before the uruguayan had a chance to tilt the tie firmly in his side 's favor . played in on goal by argentinian javier pastore , cavani rounded chelsea goalkeeper thibaut courtois but could only glance a shot off the near post from a tight angle . pastore then got into the area after neat approach play and , though he got a powerful low shot away , courtois was equal to it and palmed it clear . chelsea began to reassert its dominance as psg tired . substitute ramires weaved into the area and was denied by a fine save at his near post by salvatore sirigu . from the resulting corner a miskick from costa presented the ball at the feet of england defender cahill , who lashed home from 12 yards out . but chelsea were unable to hold out . luiz , who won the champions league with chelsea during a three-year stint at the club , had been booed throughout the game for a running battle with costa . and he rose highest to power a header into the net and make the tie level on aggregate with just four minutes remaining . psg began the extra half hour in sluggish fashion and were punished when silva needlessly handled a looping cross into the area as he went up to challenge substitute kurt zouma for the ball . belgium international eden hazard duly tucked the penalty away , to restore chelsea 's lead and ensure the tie would not go to penalties . still chelsea looked edgy . courtois was forced to make a world class save from silva , as the brazilian desperately tried to make amends for his handball . but despite that warning , silva netted with a fine header from the very next corner , looping a brilliant header over the goalkeeper from 14 yards out . after the game mourinho admitted psg had `` clearly '' been the better side : `` our performance was not good enough , '' he told sky sports . `` we had the game in our hands twice but i think psg were stronger than us and coped better with the pressure of the game . '' german champions bayern munich cemented its place in the last eight with a comprehensive 7-0 dismantling of shakhtar donetsk . after a 0-0 draw in the first leg in ukraine , shakhtar 's task became an uphill one inside four minutes when olexandr kucher was dismissed for bringing down mario götze inside the penalty area . thomas muller tucked home the resulting penalty , and bayern subsequently laid siege to shakhtar 's goal . robert lewandowski nodded rafinha 's cross against the post before pep guardiola 's side doubled its advantage just after the half hour mark . defender jerome boateng had the simple task of tapping home from point blank range after former dortmund striker lewandowski 's effort had been saved . bayern ran riot after the break , france international franck ribery grabbing the third with a fine low finish after a powerful run into the area . muller grabbed a second moments later before holger badstuber made it five with a thumping header . lewandowski finally got on the score sheet before götze completed the rout .

'' #cyclonepam still tearing through #vanuatu . ` much bigger than expected , ' says our colleague in port vila . initial reports of devastation , '' the australian branch of unicef said on twitter earlier . pam , one of the strongest storms seen in the south pacific in years , earlier made a direct hit on the capital , raising fears of mass destruction . in its 8 a.m. saturday update , the vanuatu meteorological services warned of `` very destructive hurricane force winds '' of 155 mph -lrb- 250 kilometers per hour -rrb- in shefa and tafea provinces , with several others facing `` very rough to phenomenal seas with heavy swells . '' the joint typhoon warning center in pearl harbor , hawaii , said the cyclone had weakened from the equivalent of a category 5 hurricane to a category 4 . it has dumped more than 9 inches of rain on the capital in a 36-hour period and has wind gusts of up to 190 mph -lrb- 305 kph -rrb- . track the storm . pam is forecast to move southeastward along the western edge of the southern islands of vanuatu . it is n't expected to make any additional landfalls before dissipating . it will continue to weaken as it crosses cooler waters and encounters higher wind shear . pam is expected to pass east of new zealand on sunday and into monday . it could bring heavy rainfall to north island , including auckland . the capital , the biggest city in the vanuatu island chain , sits on the coastline , which is vulnerable to storm surges during powerful cyclones . tropical cyclone pam is the strongest storm to make landfall since the devastating super typhoon haiyan hit the philippines in 2013 . chloe morrison , an emergency communications director for the humanitarian organization world vision , told cnn that she could see some light between her boarded-up windows but it was still hard to see the totality of the destruction outside the house where she and seven others huddled in a back room during the storm . `` seven hours hunkered down and it 's still not safe to go outside , '' she said . `` the winds are still really howling . we 're really lucky to be in a concrete house . '' part of the tin roof twisted off the house and landed by one of the windows , she said . she also noted that two trees outside did n't get uprooted , but they had not one bit of fruit or any leaves remaining . despite the `` quite terrifying ordeal , '' morrison said , their house did n't have any damage . through the night , the wind and torrential rain made it sound like an angry ocean was just outside their doors , she said . world vision , which says it 's been based in vanuatu for more than 30 years , said its emergency assessment team would head out to view the damage when it is safe . the staff helped prepare communities on the islands for the cyclone by positioning water , food , blankets , tarpaulins , and shelter , hygiene and kitchen kits in key places , it said , as well as advising on disaster preparedness . residents have been advised to seek shelter in places such as churches , universities and schools . `` the strongest thing they 've got is cement churches , '' said inga mepham , program director for care international for the vanuatu program . `` some of them do n't have that . it 's hard to find a structure that you 'd think would be able to withstand a category 5 -lrb- storm -rrb- . '' earlier , photographer michael mclennan -- who said the storm is being called the `` vanuatu monster '' -- told cnn that the `` strength of winds is incredible . '' video footage he shot earlier friday showed palm trees being whipped by wind and rain . evacuation alerts have been issued for several parts of the country . even before the sun rose saturday , vanuatu was already getting hit hard , with most communication and power cut off due to the storm . `` the wind outside is terrifying , '' michael wolfe , world vision 's national director in vanuatu , told that organization . `` i ca n't imagine what it 's like for families out there who were n't able to find safe shelter before the storm . '' the archipelago nation northeast of australia contains 83 small islands , many of which have little infrastructure and lack the strong housing structures that can endure a walloping storm . because of the tropical climate in vanuatu , some of the housing is made of lighter building materials , including straw and corrugated metals . residents prepared for the storm , boarding up windows and chopping down trees that stand close to buildings in case they could become debris or cause further damage or injury . cnn host bill weir , who was recently in vanuatu on assignment , said that while port vila has some modern development in the form of an airport , large hotels and a convention center that 's under construction , life on some of the islands has remained almost unchanged for thousands of years . `` for search and rescue , for bringing food and supplies and medicine , it 's extremely challenging , '' he said . pam has triggered watches and warnings in the solomon islands and new zealand . cnn 's greg botelho and derek van dam contributed to this report .

'' of course , the leg irons could have been used on a federal sailor or soldier taken captive . but that did n't occur with the confederate ironclad . it was scuttled in december 1864 , having never fired a shot in anger while it defended the city . about 400 artifacts have been brought up by divers in the initial stage of the recovery of the css georgia , which must be moved for a deepening of the shipping channel . `` we have scratched the surface as far as the artifacts are concerned . there are a lot more to come up , '' jobling told cnn on thursday . texas a&m is working with the u.s. army corps of engineers in savannah to conserve many of the artifacts for eventual display . archaeology is n't just about cool artifacts . it 's about making a connection with the humans that used these items . and while experts have n't gleaned much about the daily life of the crew from the early dives , they have found some items that would have been used by an individual : an ironstone plate commonly used in the south , a musket trigger guard and the butt stock of a gun . visibility at the site is practically nonexistent . divers have to depend on feel to locate and remove smaller items . much of it is is detritus of the wreck : small iron plates , nails and spikes . among the items cataloged since the dives formally began at the end of january are two pieces that helped with the business end of the css georgia : its cannons . four of the artillery pieces are amid the wreckage about 40 feet down on the floor of the savannah river . one iron piece had eyes , or holes , that connected a gun carriage to ropes that the ironclad 's crew manipulated to move the gun forward and backward . another piece , a trunnion cap , helped hold the cannon to the carriage . divers and archaeologists are following a timetable and grid in the recovery , with smaller items being brought up by hand . a previous salvage effort and damage from dredging displaced some of the artifacts . other items remain right where they fell . `` someone undid the engine , moved it and was dropped '' into the depths , said jobling . contract divers are out on the site every day , weather permitting , not more than a couple miles east of the city 's famous river street and waterfront . the $ 15 million removal of the css georgia is necessary for the state and federal harbor deepening project , which will see the channel go from 42 to a uniform 47 feet so massive cargo container ships can use the port without relying on the tide . in june or july , u.s. navy divers are expected be on site , to bring up the larger pieces : two engines , the propeller , a steam condenser , the four guns and the casemates that housed them . one of the casemates is large : 68 feet by 24 feet . four artillery shells will be recovered , with the u.s. marine corps to render them safe for museum display . the wooden lower hull no longer exists . the css georgia did n't have enough power to maneuver and effectively trade artillery rounds with any enemy vessels that might approach from the atlantic ocean . instead , the vessel became a stationary floating battery , bristling with artillery pieces . the yankees refused to take on the css georgia or other nearby defense obstructions . archaeologists have the challenge of preserving portions of the css georgia through chemical and other means , making her iron stable so the remains one day can be displayed . conservation of selected artifacts and parts will be done at texas a&m and will take about two years to complete . state and local officials hope conserved pieces will be exhibited somewhere in the city . much of the css georgia is corroded , and archaeologists are gauging the integrity of each piece for conservation . but many pieces remain in pretty good shape . an x-ray of one of the leg irons shows a fair bit of corrosion . experts will inject epoxy to fill those gaps and remove any concretion on the iron , said jobling . officials need more artifacts and investigation to tell the story of the crew . `` hopefully , there is a section of the wreck that will tell the human side of the css georgia , '' said jobling . while salvage operations soon after the civil war removed a lot of iron from the site , there 's a chance personal items survive , especially if they are below the sediment line and protected from the ravages of oxygen . interestingly , the vessel 's crew had to run the main engine constantly , just to keep it afloat . why ? that 's because the css georgia 's green wood made it susceptible to leaks . so on december 21 , 1864 , just as union maj. gen. william t. sherman 's hordes of soldiers reached savannah , the ironclad 's crew likely opened its water valves . the css georgia silently slipped below the surface . the sailors used small boats to get to shore and began a 20-mile walk from savannah . `` they took what they could carry with them , '' jobling said .
<s> five tourists have had their car keys snatched by vigilantes this year . </s> <s> the confiscations have taken place amid rising concern over tourist driving behavior . </s> <s> in popular westland , 37 % of serious crashes have involved foreign drivers . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- vigilante motorists in new zealand have taken to snatching the car keys of foreign drivers amid rising concern over dangerous driving by tourists . new zealand media have reported five cases this year of locals forcibly taking the keys of foreign motorists after witnessing driving that concerned them . all the incidents -- which have been condemned by authorities -- took place in the south island , which draws tourists from around the world for its rugged scenery , including lakes and mountains featured in director peter jackson 's `` lord of the rings '' films . the incidents occurred amid heightened public concern over tourist driving standards , with eight people killed in crashes involving foreign drivers in the space of a fortnight last month . among the dead were a family of four from hong kong who were killed when their car crossed the center line and collided with a logging truck . the key snatchings have even prompted prime minister john key to weigh in on the issue , advising that `` people taking the law into their own hands is not sensible . '' new zealand police assistant commissioner of road policing dave cliff said the confiscations existed in a legal gray area , as there was no explicit statute dealing with the issue . although there might be exceptional circumstances where taking someone 's keys could be legally justified , such as preventing drunken driving , he said , `` in the vast majority of cases , it wo n't be . '' `` that extends to physically assaulting or abusing someone in response to their driving , which is simply not acceptable , and anyone found doing so should expect to face the consequences , '' he said . diesel mechanic robert penman of dunedin made headlines last month after he took the keys of a chinese couple who had stopped their car on a narrow single-lane road to take pictures , causing a backlog of vehicles behind them . `` i was coming into town with my wife and son and came around the corner , and there was a car stopped in the middle of the road , '' he told cnn affiliate tvnz . he called police and took their keys as `` a safety thing , you know , timeframe for police to get there , '' he said . the new zealand transport agency later revealed that penman was driving on an expired license himself . penman told local media it was not the first time he had taken a tourist 's car keys . only 6 % of crashes in new zealand involve foreign drivers , according to the latest figures provided by the ministry of transport . but in some remote regions of the south island particularly popular with tourists for their scenery -- such as the mackenzie , southland , queenstown-lakes and kaikoura districts -- foreign drivers are involved in about a quarter of all crashes . in westland district , on the south island 's rugged west coast , foreign drivers are involved in 37 % of road crashes resulting in death or injury . tony kokshoorn , mayor of the neighboring grey district , said tourist driving behavior was a major problem in the region and attributed the issue to tourists from countries that drive on the right . new zealanders drive on the left . `` there 's a huge number of tourists coming through to these destinations because of the scenery , but the scenery is a problem , '' he said . `` there 's so many beautiful sights to see that they 're not concentrating on their driving . once they lose their concentration , they tend to fall into old habits and drive on the right . even for 20 seconds , it can cause damage . '' a ministry of transport spokesperson said that while this was a factor , figures showed that australian and british drivers were involved in the most crashes overall , `` so unfamiliarity with which side of the road to drive on is not the only factor . '' kokshoorn said that he had seen three cases of tourists driving on the wrong side of the road recently but that the vigilante approach -- which had seen a visitor to his town punched in the face as he was stripped of his keys last month -- was `` disgraceful . '' he said the best approach was better education on local driving conditions for foreign drivers , particularly at the rental companies where they picked up their vehicles . anyone with a foreign drivers license or permit is able to drive in new zealand for up to a year . associate transport minister craig foss said the government recognized that `` many people are concerned with poor driving behavior on challenging roads in and around popular tourist destinations '' and had established a project in response . the measures include improvements to roading , such as `` keep left '' signage and no-passing markings on the extensive stretches of single-lane highway , and educational resources targeted at visiting drivers , including many targeting the growing chinese market . kokshoorn said it was important to `` strike the right balance '' in getting the message to foreign drivers to take care on the unfamiliar roads . `` we value tourism and the dollars it brings to new zealand , especially to our region here . we do n't want to put tourists off , but we want them to be safe in our country , '' he said . `` you cross that center line , and anything 's possible .

<s> levy : israel 's occupation of palestinian territory has gone mostly undiscussed ahead of tuesday 's election . </s> <s> levy : netanyahu , herzog do n't have the courage to end the occupation . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- are the upcoming elections in israel crucial ? will the results -- a fourth term for prime minister benjamin netanyahu or a first for opposition leader isaac herzog -- change israel 's policy in a significant way ? as israelis prepare to go to the polls , the answer seems to be negative . many observers in europe and the united states seem to be under the impression that during netanyahu 's time in power , israel was hijacked by right wing zealots -- and that herzog , leader of the zionist union opposition party , is the man who will save the country and return it to the path of sanity . but the fact is that when it comes to the most crucial question regarding the future of israel and the middle east -- what to do about the palestinians -- the difference between the two candidates is negligible , a divergence that is short on substance but long on style and rhetoric . while netanyahu 's insistence on israel 's continued ruling over millions of palestinians is expressed in aggressive , often religious and nationalistic language , herzog 's justifications for doing the same thing would sound much softer and easier to digest in the western world . but at the end of the day , neither netanyahu nor herzog have any real intention to put an end to the occupation of the palestinian territories . netanyahu says it clearly and openly ; herzog and his coalition partners only hint at it . read more : 5 key issues for next israeli leader . this whitewash has been so evident throughout the entire election campaign that a foreigner arriving in israel would have had a hard time understanding anything about what is really going on here . the main issues that have been discussed during the campaign are economic ones -- cost of living , housing prices , government oversight -- but even then , slogans and populist promises have largely replaced the in-depth debates we should be having . but the topics that seem to have consumed most of the headlines range from pure gossip to scandals , some of them concerning the behavior of netanyahu and his wife sara . there was the `` bottlegate '' affair -- claims that the wife of the prime minister had pocketed cash from bottle recycling at their official residence . the netanyahus say they reimbursed the government . israel is a country that is still looking for its way forward ; one that lacks internationally recognized borders ; one that has not yet decided whether it is a western society or a middle eastern one ; one that can not decide whether it wants to be religious or secular , jewish or bi-national . all of these critical issues -- none of them decided on -- have been cast aside , ignored , covered up or denied by a country that has busied itself with the important business of recycled bottles at the prime minister 's residence . there is a big elephant in the room , but israel is turning its back to it . there is a big elephant in the room , but israel believes that if nobody talks about it , the elephant does not exist . this elephant is absent from the israeli discourse on a day-to-day basis , and it is absent during elections -- a time when public discourse should be only be focused on what really matters . the elephant in the israeli room is the unending occupation of palestinian territories , and nobody is talking about it . most of the parties running in the elections have not even bothered to try to answer questions about what their plans are for the palestinians . but the occupation also continues to be a non-issue for too many ordinary israelis , who know very little -- and care even less -- about the cruel reality for the millions of palestinians who live without civil rights in the west bank and who are kept under siege in gaza . for those who regard herzog and the center-left as the great hope of this campaign , it is important to remember that it was the israeli labor party who established the occupation and settlement projects in palestinian territory . golda meir , moshe dayan , shimon peres , yitzhak rabin : those labor leaders , so beloved by the west , are the founding fathers of the most significant venture of modern israel -- the illegal transfer of a jewish population to stolen land . it was a project whose purpose was to prevent any kind of equal division of the land , or a settlement with the palestinians -- and as such it has been a great success story . labor never had a real plan for the palestinians , except to time and again renew the endless peace process , which may be the longest in history . this is still true now , on the eve of elections that stand a real chance of bringing the zionist union to power . the more than 500,000 settlers in the west bank and east jerusalem have created what may be an irreversible reality , but herzog 's only answer to it is to get back to the negotiation table . in private circles he mentions five years as the time he needs to conclude the process . there is no better indication that herzog has no intention of ending the occupation any time soon . numerous peace plans have already been worked out in great detail ; all that is needed is for one courageous israeli leader to implement any one of them . herzog , at least at this stage , does not seem to be the one capable of doing this . on tuesday the `` only democracy in the middle east '' will elect a new parliament and a new government , in what is frequently described as a celebration of `` people power . '' but the reality is that here in israel , it is only the masters who will vote and decide on the future -- not only for themselves , but for the millions of palestinians who have for nearly half a century been living under their control , directly in the west bank and indirectly in gaza . and yet , it seems , their fate is not a topic worthy of discussion . to call this a democracy in 2015 is rather problematic .

<s> 3 police officers described an intense gun battle with boston marathon bomb suspects . </s> <s> they said the 2 men shot at them , threw bombs and tried to run them over . </s> <s> jurors see the boat where dzhokhar tsarnaev hid before his arrest . </s><sec>boston -lrb- cnn -rrb- eight minutes of sheer terror . that 's what police officers from watertown , massachusetts , described in heart-stopping detail monday , revealing details of a chaotic shootout with the boston marathon bombing suspects . one of the suspects , tamerlan tsarnaev , died from injuries he sustained that day -- wounded in a gun battle , then run over by his brother , dzhokhar . dzhokhar tsarnaev managed to escape , but was later caught by police . now he 's on trial , facing 30 charges for the marathon bombings , which killed three people and injured more than 260 others . the shootout with police in the early morning hours of april 19 , 2013 , marked one of the most dramatic chapters in the manhunt for the suspects who paralyzed the boston metropolitan area for days . it started , patrolman joseph reynolds testified , soon after he locked eyes with tamerlan tsarnaev , who he spotted driving an suv that matched a description of a stolen vehicle . reynolds called for backup . it was n't long before tamerlan and dzhokhar tsarnaev were firing guns , throwing bombs and trying to run officers over with a stolen suv , reynolds said . `` tamerlan tsarnaev got out of the driver 's side door and began shooting at my cruiser , '' reynolds said . soon , the officer said he ran out of bullets . sgt. jeffrey pugliese saw what looked like muzzle flashes as soon as he arrived at the scene . `` i put my vehicle in park , i took a round through the windshield , i was sprayed with glass and i knew , ok , we were being fired on , '' said sgt. john maclellan . then the two brothers began throwing improvised explosives , including pipe bombs and a pressure cooker bomb , the officers testified . `` i noticed one was bigger than the other , and they had different styles when they were throwing the devices , '' maclellan said . `` one was throwing like a baseball . '' maclellan said the pressure cooker bomb `` was incredibly loud . i had to holster my weapon . my eyes were shaking violently in my head . i could n't see . '' pugliese said he opened fire when he saw one of the men , tamerlan tsarnaev , charging toward him . pugliese fired and the man threw his pistol at the officer , hitting him in the bicep . pugliese tackled him . and with tamerlan tsarnaev , who was wounded from gunfire , on the ground , the three officers tried to put him in handcuffs . they thought they 'd be able to arrest him . but then something changed . `` we were wrestling with tamerlan , and all of a sudden i could hear an engine revving , '' reynolds said . the suv , reynolds said , was heading straight toward the officers . the dramatic descriptions of the shootout monday sounded like a scene from a hollywood film , said boston globe columnist kevin cullen . but the most extraordinary revelation in court , he said , was that the night could have ended very differently . `` dzhokhar tsarnaev did not have to go back and run his brother over . he actually did a three-point turn and reversed the vehicle . he could have sped off and run away , '' cullen told cnn 's `` the lead with jake tapper . '' he was in a much better position to flee . but apparently he decided to do a u-turn and come back . '' the sight of the stolen suv speeding toward them caught the officers by surprise . `` i reached down and i grabbed tamerlan by the back of the belt and tried to drag him out of the street so he would n't be hit , '' pugliese said . `` the black suv , it was right in my face . ... i kind of laid back and felt the wind from the vehicle as it went by . '' but they did n't move tamerlan in time . his body became hung up in the rear wheels and he was dragged a short distance , pugliese said . the prosecutor asked pugliese if there was something in the road that forced the suv driver to go directly at the officers . `` no , '' he said . `` it was accelerating at a very high rate of speed . '' later that day , tamerlan tsarnaev was pronounced dead at a local hospital , with the cause listed as `` traumatic injuries '' to the head and torso . his fingerprints led to the identification of the suspects . officers discovered that richard donohue , a massachusetts bay transportation authority officer , had been hit by friendly fire during the shootout . he survived , but nearly bled to death . dzhokhar tsarnaev was arrested about 8:45 p.m. that same day , hiding in a boat called the `` slip away '' that was stowed in a backyard in watertown . jurors saw photos of the boat last week . but on monday , they got a chance to see the boat , which has become a key piece of evidence in the trial , in person . before the trial started , prosecutors and defense attorneys had sparred over how much of the boat jurors would get to see . the prosecution sought to remove a panel on which tsarnaev allegedly scrawled incriminating messages so that jurors could see it with their own eyes . defense attorney david bruck argued that cutting out a panel would take the written words out of context and would n't fairly reflect tsarnaev 's state of mind . in south boston , about a mile from the courthouse , jurors intently looked at the entire boat monday . it had been loaded onto a semi truck and moved to the location for viewing by the jury . dzhokhar tsarnaev , wearing a dark jacket and no handcuffs or shackles , watched the jurors but showed little emotion or expression . jurors appeared to strain to make out the words tsarnaev scrawled inside the boat . the boat was riddled with more than 100 bullet holes -- some of which punctured tsarnaev 's words . aaron cooper reported from boston . catherine e. shoichet and ralph ellis wrote the story in atlanta . cnn 's jake tapper and ann o'neill contributed to this report .

'' unfortunately she had declined our request to be interviewed . she 's never done one and does n't plan to . she wants the limelight to be on her husband . the duchess of cornwall had however allowed our cameras to get close enough to pick up sound during some of her public appearances . that would give viewers a greater sense of her character than they had had before . when prince charles arrived , he also insisted on meeting the crew , which was great but was also eating into our interview time . in the end , we had the full 20 minutes as planned . you can make your own judgements of the tv special , but i think we did manage to give you a good sense of him . he was comfortable enough to be himself . he was the same person on camera as off . afterward , we walked through the house and into the garden for some additional shots . the duchess of cornwall joined us on the way and was worried i would be cold without a coat , but the coat was inaccessible and i did n't want to hold things up . you ca n't tell an awful lot about someone by spending just a morning with them , particularly as a journalist , but my impression was that they are close , connected and have fun . i then left them to take a stroll on their own with the crew , who captured some shots that i think have a small place in royal history -- a glimpse of a couple enjoying each other 's company in their private wilderness , before he ascends to the throne .
<s> on monday , 47 republican senators sent an open letter to iran . </s> <s> sally kohn : only most extreme example of dishonor and disrespect . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- just when you did n't think republicans could top themselves in finding ways to disrespect the president of the united states , on monday , 47 republican senators -- that is , all but seven -- sent a letter to iran that appeared aimed at scuttling president obama 's diplomatic efforts to prevent tehran developing nuclear weapons capacity . the move comes on the heels of house republicans inviting israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to address congress -- without even informing the white house of the plan to issue an invitation . but this latest measure went a step further , seeing republicans in congress literally stepping on the constitutional toes of the executive branch and formally intruding on u.s. diplomacy . under the logan act passed by congress way back in 1799 , u.s. citizens are prevented from influencing `` disputes or controversies '' involving the united states and a foreign government , without express authority to do so . now , it appears the iran letter was carefully drafted by sen. tom cotton , a smart constitutional lawyer , to come as close as possible to the line of legality without crossing it , specifically by not explicitly taking a position against the iran negotiations . yet the intent to interfere with the executive branch is clear . it 's one thing for congress to demand it ratify such a deal -lrb- as democrats did in 2002 when president bush negotiated arms reductions with russian president vladimir putin -rrb- . but it 's something else entirely to undermine the authority of the white house by sending a partisan letter to a foreign government -lrb- something democrats did n't do with russia -rrb- . sadly , this is only the most recent and extreme example of dishonor and disrespect . in the washington post , columnist jonathan capehart recently outlines what he sees as the top six instances of disrespect toward president obama . his list includes the example of former new york mayor rudy giuliani saying , `` i do not believe that the president loves america . '' also on capehart 's list are the time a reporter from the conservative daily caller website interrupted the president during remarks at the white house about immigration reform in 2012 , and the time south carolina congressman joe wilson , a republican , heckled the president during his speech to a joint session of congress about health care reform . -lrb- wilson shouted `` you lie ! '' in response to remarks by the president that , it should be noted , were in fact quite true -rrb- . and there are plenty more examples of republican slights against president obama . most famously , there was the widespread questioning of obama 's citizenship and academic credentials that included signs at conservative rallies describing obama as a `` lyin ' african . '' and there was the republican women 's group that created an image of `` food stamp dollars '' with obama 's face on them -lrb- as well as a bucket of kfc and watermelon -rrb- . there was also republican presidential candidate and former speaker of the house newt gingrich decrying obama 's `` kenyan , anti-colonial behavior . '' plus there was then-arizona gov. jan brewer waving her finger at president obama when she greeted air force one on the tarmac . brewer later alleged she `` felt a little bit threatened '' by the president . taken as a whole , this list suggests a troubling pattern of profound disrespect for the president . but more than this , it seems to reflect an anti-obama fever that has gripped the republican party -- one that the letter to iran suggests shows no signs of breaking , and is a sure sign of sickness in the republican party . is the lack of respect being shown toward president obama about race , as some have suggested ? yes and no . certainly , for a segment of the country , it really is about being uncomfortable with a black president . indeed , even former secretary of state colin powell , a republican , noted what he described as a `` dark vein '' of intolerance in the party and parts of the country in general . but beyond that hopefully shrinking share of the population that is explicitly racist , there is a far wider issue of implicit racial bias -- an unconscious , yet nonetheless real tendency , to subject president obama to extra scrutiny because of the color of his skin . none of this is to suggest that all of the criticism aimed at president obama stems from implicit racial bias . but such bias appears to be a factor in the ease and extremity of disrespect aimed at america 's first black president . and this disrespect mirrors the disrespect shown against black americans in general . `` honorable people can disagree over policy , '' vice president joe biden said in a statement tuesday . yes , and they should do so honorably . whatever republicans ' gripes about president obama 's vision and leadership , the party and its followers are too often expressing their critiques in an ugly way . and that rampant pattern of disrespect -- for any fellow human being , let alone the president of the united states of america -- is what truly undermines the principles and values of our nation .
<s> nypd commissioner : chiefs need to embrace need for change . </s> <s> ferguson might look to sanford , florida 's experience when choosing a new chief . </s> <s> that city also had to find ways to heal divisions between community and police . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- empathy . confidence . passion . these are the traits the next police chief in ferguson , missouri , will need to shrink the ocean of distrust between community and police . so says cecil smith . and maybe he should know . smith is the police chief in sanford , florida , another community rocked by racial tensions and poor police-community relations after the high-profile shooting of a black teenager -- the 2012 death of trayvon martin . and if smith 's experience is any guide , it will take `` a lot of prayer and a little goading '' to convince someone to step into the job vacated this week by chief thomas jackson . `` that community , as we see , has been hurting and struggling for some time now , '' he says . and how : . -- the community remains deeply scarred by the events last year , after the august shooting death of unarmed african-american teenager michael brown by a white ferguson officer darren wilson , and the november decision by the st. louis county grand jury not to charge wilson , who later resigned . occasionally violent protests and sometimes heavy-handed responses by police deepened divisions and distrust . -- the police department was already groaning under the epic weight of months of nearly constant protest and last week 's release of a damning department of justice report that found evidence of discriminatory conduct on the part of ferguson officials . -- add to that the obvious fears facing officers following the shooting early thursday of two police officers only hours after jackson resigned . the decision for jackson to step aside was a mutual one between the chief and city , mayor james knowles told reporters . he 'll get severance and a year of health insurance and will turn the reins over to ferguson police lt. col al eickhoff next week . the city will launch a nationwide search for a permanent replacement , knowles said . `` the city of ferguson looks to become an example of how a community can move forward in the face of adversity . we are committed to keeping our police department and having one that exhibits the highest degree of professionalism and fairness , '' said knowles -- who has himself been targeted by protesters demanding he resign . to get there , it might look to sanford for guidance . there , trust in the police department bottomed out in the aftermath of the trayvon martin shooting . while no police officers were involved in the shooting , anger over their perceived failure to arrest the teenager 's killer , george zimmerman , pushed relations in the community to a boiling point , eventually resulting in the firing of chief bill lee . zimmerman eventually was arrested , and a jury acquitted him . smith watched the chaos play out from elgin , illinois , where he was deputy police chief . a former boss in illinois suggested he look at the job , so he traveled to florida on his own time , getting to know the community and learning what divided residents and police . he still is n't sure how to explain why he took the job . `` the first year , i was still wondering , was it a smart move ? '' smith joked . but things are better now , he says . after taking the job , smith made it a point of spending time `` walking and talking '' in sanford , building relationships with community leaders and everyday residents . inside the department , stepped up training in engagement and ethical policing . he also stepped up recruitment of african-american officers . `` one of the things that 's going on is we do n't have people who look like us in the community , '' said smith , himself an african-american . he handed out long-delayed promotions . and he even presided over a makeover , enlisting officers to help choose new uniforms . the new chief in ferguson will likely need to do some of the same things , smith says . community leaders and other officials agree . `` we need to deal with the culture issue here to make sure whoever is coming in behind chief jackson is not a new face and a new name on the same type of issues , '' patricia bynes , a democratic committeewoman for ferguson township , '' told cnn wednesday . `` we need to seriously deal with the culture of the police department and the municipal courts and the way the city is run . '' new york police commissioner william bratton said there are two issues confronting the heads of police forces . there is the lack of trust on the community 's part and the lack of confidence some officers have in their leadership . on the first issue , he said : `` you need to be willing to embrace that there is a need to change . '' to police leadership consultant john vanek , whoever takes over the ferguson department will need to have the same leadership traits valued in boardrooms across the world -- the ability to form partnerships across organizational lines , to think differently , to turn failure into success and to do it all in a harsh media spotlight . but that 's easier said than done . `` there 's going to be a lot of hostility in ferguson for a long time , '' he said . so will the new chief need to be african-american to help defuse the racial tensions roiling the city ? here 's the politic answer : find the right candidate , regardless of race . `` you want to find the best candidate to be police chief , '' said attorney benjamin crump , who has represented the families of both trayvon martin and michael brown . `` but diversity is very important . it 's very important that the police officers understand the communities , at least want to engage with members of the community they are going to be protecting and serving . '' `` there 's an old saying in the black community that everybody else is protected and served but we are policed , '' crump said . `` we do n't want to be policed . we want to be protected and served as any american citizen .

'' johnson 's arrest prompted protests among students demanding `` justice for martese '' after images circulated showing his bloodied face and clothing . while what happened wednesday remains under investigation , video from the incident shows johnson pinned to the ground , screaming : `` i go to uva ! ... you f ****** racists ! what the f *** ? how did this happen ? '' an officer can be heard telling the man to stop fighting . according to the student 's attorney , daniel watkins , `` just before handcuffing him , police took martese to the ground , striking his head on the pavement and causing him to bleed profusely from the gash on his head . '' he needed 10 stitches to close the gash in his head , watkins said . johnson was charged with public intoxication and obstruction of justice , according to the virginia department of alcoholic beverage control , which acknowledged he suffered injuries during his arrest . the agents were placed on administrative duties during the investigation , the agency said . the black student alliance said the arrest reminds black uva students `` of the gruesome reality that we are not immune to injustice . '' in a news release , the university called the arrest disturbing , and university president teresa sullivan issued a statement saying that `` every member of our community should feel safe from the threat of bodily harm and other forms of violence . '' virginia attorney general mark herring appealed for patience . `` certainly the images that we 've all been looking at in charlottesville are shocking , but it 's really important that we get the facts out and understand exactly what happened , '' johnson said . friday 's forum will be held at a theater on the uva campus . the student council said media would not be allowed to ask questions or bring cameras into the forum but said the event would be live-streamed on the internet . `` this is a student space -- a chance for students to ask the questions they feel are most pressing to virginia 's most senior law enforcement officials , '' the group said on facebook . students leaders asked their contemporaries to tweet questions in advance . as of midmorning friday , only a handful of tweets had crossed using the proposed hashtag '' #policedialogue . '' `` is the problematic influence of implicit bias discussed at all during police training , '' twitter user yaejmeister asked . among other questions , one student asked why alcohol control agents have police powers . a third wondered `` is catering to uva 's hypersensitivity preparing our students for the world outside of ` grounds ' ? '' the incident comes amid a continuing nationwide debate over the use of force by police , particularly involving african-americans , following the deaths last summer of michael brown in ferguson , missouri , and eric garner in new york . grand juries in both communities declined to indict white police officers in the deaths , leading to angry protests nationwide and calls for renewed attention to claims of police bullying and brutality .

<s> the execution of kelly gissendaner was postponed due to concerns over injection drugs . </s> <s> mcbride : in her time on death row , gissendaner has discovered hope through theology . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- i met kelly gissendaner in january 2010 in a nondescript classroom at metro state prison for women in atlanta . she arrived for class beaming with excitement about the journey she was about to begin -- participation in a yearlong academic theology program sponsored jointly by four atlanta seminaries . since she has been sentenced to the death penalty and lives in solitary confinement , kelly was particularly eager to share community with others , if only one morning a week . and she was grateful for the opportunity to explore the bible and theology in a rigorous manner that would nurture and deepen her devotional life . that image of her on the first day of class remains vivid to me because it captures the core of who kelly is -- who she has become : someone full of contagious joy and gratitude , open to others and to new experiences for growth and ministry . kelly 's process of transformation began shortly after she arrived in prison following her conviction for murder in the death of her husband , doug gissendaner . a pastor began visiting her and initiated a series of difficult , yet compassionate , conversations that urged her toward courageous self-reflection . this same pastor has been visiting kelly for almost 16 years . her commitment to kelly , along with that of the prison chaplain and chaplaincy interns , provided steady , ongoing love that fostered change . so by the time i met kelly in 2010 she had already undergone a significant transformation . she was , in the words of the apostle paul , a `` new creation '' -lrb- 2 cor . 5:17 -rrb- . in the theology program , kelly found her own voice and came to see that her reflections on christian faith could be a gift to the wider church `` on the outside , '' as well as in prison . by studying historical and contemporary christian thinkers , kelly became part of the conversations that make the christian tradition dynamic . she asked honest questions about her relationship to god , others and the world . she read scripture and grappled with centuries-old theological questions . she discovered her authentic theological voice in the midst of this work . `` from the start of the theology class i felt this hunger , '' she said in her 2011 graduation speech . `` i became so hungry for theology , and what all the classes had to offer ; you could call me a glutton . '' one of the great joys of being a theology professor is getting to know students holistically , not only as thinkers , but also as human beings wrestling with some of life 's most urgent questions . my relationship with kelly had this quality from the start . but it deepened six months into the year when a new warden arrived at the prison . in her graduation speech , kelly described this moment : . `` there came a time when ... my worst fears became my reality -- i was pulled from the courses . i was taken from my theological community . being pulled from the program devastated me as badly as if someone had just told me one of my appeals had been turned down . `` since i could n't go to the theology class ... the instructors came to me . still , this was far from being ideal because now i had to have class and community through a gate . it was hard ... but i pushed on . i pushed on because of that hunger . that gate ... was meant to keep everyone and everything separated from me . but that gate could n't keep out the knowledge that i was so hungry for , nor friendship and community . and it sure could n't keep out god . '' this change afforded us the chance to have two hours of one-on-one conversation every friday . we continued to read theological texts together , including a book by then-archbishop of canterbury rowan williams . williams describes healing and restoration as the act of facing our painful memories , `` the ruins of the past , '' and building from them here and now . restoration , williams writes , `` is going back to the memories of the painful , humiliating past and bringing them to redemption in the present ... to christ -lsb- who -rsb- comes to repair the devastation . '' i sat with kelly as she went back over some of her own painful memories , took responsibility for them and showed profound remorse about who she had been and what she had done . indeed , the power of these moments -- when kelly looked me in the eye and confessed concrete sins , when we spoke of god 's love and forgiveness -- will stay with me forever . kelly embraced what dietrich bonhoeffer , a german pastor-theologian and nazi resister , calls `` costly grace . '' for bonhoeffer , `` cheap grace '' is seeking god 's forgiveness as a `` cover-up for one 's sins , for which one has no remorse and ... even less desire to be set free . '' in contrast , costly grace requires rigorously following jesus in a way that leads to continuous , visible transformation , what the new testament calls the fruits of redemption . the fruits of kelly 's redemption are now well-documented : reconciliation with her children , ministry to inmates full of despair , counsel to troubled youth and daily concern for others . on the night kelly thought would be her last , she spent the evening writing a letter to her fellow inmates , urging them not to worry about her , but to be encouraged . most poignant for kelly are the writings of german theologian jürgen moltmann , who is widely known as the `` theologian of hope '' and with whom kelly began corresponding in 2010 . moltmann shows that biblical hope is not a hope that gives up on this life and looks for something better beyond the grave . rather , hope makes manifest the kingdom of god now -- god 's intended social order `` on earth as it is in heaven '' -lrb- matt . 6:10 -rrb- . biblical hope `` revolutionizes and transforms the present . '' it is the hope of the psalmist who `` looks for the goodness of god in this life '' -lrb- ps . 27:13 -rrb- . in the words of kelly 's favorite scripture , it is a hope that proclaims : `` i shall not die but live , and declare the works of the lord '' -lrb- ps 118:17 -rrb- . in kelly 's own words : . `` the theology program has shown me that hope is still alive and that , despite a gate or a guillotine hovering over my head , i still possess the ability to prove that i am human . labels on anyone can be notoriously misleading and unforgiving things . but no matter the label attached to me , i have the capacity and the unstoppable desire to accomplish something positive and have a lasting impact ... even prison can not erase my hope or conviction that the future is not settled for me , or anyone . '' many people have asked me in recent days how i have been transformed by my friendship with kelly and by kelly 's journey of hope . while i struggle to find adequate words , what i do know is that kelly 's story pushes the logic of christian faith to its outermost limits . it pushes christians to reexamine and reaffirm the truths we proclaim about repentance , forgiveness , redemption and hope . indeed , even professional theologians and life-long pastors struggle with the weight of the claims we make . today , kelly 's life hangs in the balance . the state of georgia on monday issued a last-minute postponement of her execution , citing concerns about the drugs that were to be used to kill her . the department of corrections has said that it plans to resume executions once an analysis of the drugs is complete . while gov. nathan deal does not have the formal power to commute kelly 's sentence to life in prison , i join more than 1,100 faith leaders from across the nation , including more than 500 from georgia , who have signed a letter urging the governor to use his political influence to save kelly 's life and to speak out publicly against her execution . i call on all people of good will to reach out to gov. deal and to georgia state legislators to demand a more just , merciful , and accountable system of justice -- for kelly and for all . as theologian richard amesbury wrote , `` if the life even of a convicted murderer can be turned around and so radically redirected , then none of us is without hope . '' we need to hear kelly gissendaner proclaim to us -- as much as we proclaim to her -- that the promises of god are real .

'' drew knows just how big an impact that high-profile stage can have on aspiring professionals from beyond the major college ranks . his last-second shot for valparaiso to beat the university of mississippi in the first round of the 1998 tournament is one of the most replayed moments in march madness history . how it works : . selection sunday -lrb- march 15 -rrb- . a 10-member panel determines seedings for the 68 teams that make the knockout tournament . first four -lrb- march 17-18 -rrb- . a format started in 2011 , 8 teams compete to qualify in the main draw . second round -lrb- march 19-20 -rrb- . 64 teams split into 4 regions : midwest , west , south and east . # 1 plays # 16 in each group . third round -lrb- march 21-22 -rrb- . down to 32 teams . regional semifinals -lrb- march 26-27 -rrb- . known as the `` sweet sixteen '' regional finals -lrb- march 28-29 -rrb- . the `` elite eight '' national semifinals -lrb- april 4 -rrb- . the `` final four '' is played at lucas oil stadium in indianapolis ; minimum capacity 70,000 . championship game -lrb- april 6 -rrb- . one of the most-watched events in u.s. sport . `` i had always dreamed of winning the game in the ncaa tournament -lrb- and -rrb- always dreamed of making the last-second shot . for god to bless -lrb- me -rrb- with both of things at one time is something that i 'll always cherish and remember , '' drew says . his father , homer drew , was valparaiso 's coach at the time , and his brother scott -lrb- now men 's basketball coach at baylor university -rrb- was an assistant , completing the hollywood scenario . `` i do n't think any of us realized that they would show that replay the next year , and even the next year , and the next year . we were just so happy in the moment and never thought that we 'd be able to talk about it over a decade later , '' he says . showing the highlight is virtually a prerequisite whenever drew coaches a nationally televised game , and is sure to come up next week when his crusaders play in the `` big dance '' -lrb- one more nickname for the tournament . -rrb- . drew was a senior nearing graduation at the time . although he had heard about professional scouts attending his games , being drafted by an nba team was still considered a longshot . after all , the last time a valparaiso graduate dribbled a basketball in the nba was in 1956 . but that was before `` the shot . '' although drew says private workouts for pro teams solidified his spot as the first valparaiso player to be drafted in the nba 's first round -lrb- as the 16th pick , -rrb- he confesses that tournament attention is likely what got his foot in the door . `` it helped me get my name out there , because they got to see me play against a different type of athlete in the ncaa tournament on a different stage , '' he says . observing athletes during march madness -- when competition is at its highest level -- is the best way to gauge if they will succeed as pros , according to one player representative . `` it definitely helps an agent to learn how a player will perform under a national stage , '' says jared karnes , co-founder of a3 athletics agency in knoxville , tennessee . `` if they want to play in the nba , they are going to be expected to play under a tremendous amount of pressure and attention . '' michael beasley , the second overall selection in the 2008 nba draft , is one of karnes ' clients who has failed to live up to that pressure so far . now 26 , he recently found his way back to the nba with the miami heat after a spell in china . karnes , a former player himself at little-known belmont university who `` had the unfortunate assignment of having to guard bryce drew , '' says he enjoys recruiting clients from smaller programs because they lack the air of entitlement that can weigh on household names . `` a lot of times they 've had to work their way into the spotlight , and so they develop a hard work ethic , '' he says . `` they really have an appreciation about what 's happened to them ; the more you can identify a talent with a level of high character , as an agent you 've just found a terrific prospect . '' among the most successful small-program players in the nba is former davidson standout stephen curry -- the current mvp frontrunner with the golden state warriors . norris cole , who played at cleveland state and won two championships with the miami heat , and gordon hayward , a starting forward for the utah jazz , have also made their mark . cole strikes a particular chord with drew since they both came out of the unheralded horizon league , a division one conference made up of nine midwestern schools . it was the less glamorous side of the game that set cole apart from other prospects . `` his defense is what helped him get drafted from our league , '' says drew , who suited up for four nba teams in six seasons before playing in italy and spain . `` a lot of guys can score and shoot , but when you get to the nba , really being able to defend someone separates you . '' hayward led butler -- a so-called `` mid-major '' program that exited the horizon league two years ago -- all the way to the 2010 national championship game against duke , only to watch his desperation half-court shot narrowly miss at the buzzer . although hayward turned pro after the two-point loss , butler 's exposure to potential recruits allowed the bulldogs to return to the championship game the next year , and to the third round in 2013 . with an enrollment of only 4,500 students , it is the smallest school to play in the final for over 30 years . in 2013 , butler 's 36-year-old brad stevens became the youngest head coach in the nba when he signed a $ 22 million contract with the boston celtics . `` even though they are so wildly successful as a team -lrb- now , -rrb- butler right before that was n't well known , '' says karnes , adding that it was hayward who first put it on the map . `` you can find diamonds in these smaller schools . '' drew hopes to emulate butler 's past success this postseason . he 's already led valparaiso to its highest victory total and winning percentage in school history . led by 6-foot-10-inch jamaican senior vashil fernandez -lrb- five blocked shots against green bay in the horizon league tournament final -rrb- and 6 ' 9 '' sophomore alec peters , the crusaders are hoping for a high seed when a 10-member committee meets this `` selection sunday '' to rank the tournament 's 68 participants . valparaiso 's nightmare scenario would be an early-round pairing with last year 's runner-up kentucky . the wildcats -lrb- 31-0 -rrb- aim to become the first team to go undefeated and win the national championship since the indiana hoosiers in 1976 . drew calls coach john calipari 's team -- powered by a front line of 7-footers willie cauley-stein and dakari johnson , along with 6 ' 11 '' karl-anthony towns -- as the deepest he 's ever seen in college basketball . six of kentucky 's players are considered worthy of june 's nba draft . while karnes remains guarded about which college basketball players he 's scouting , inking deals with kentucky players after the tournament is probably a longshot . `` you talk about these smaller schools that are out there , we 're that way as a boutique agency , '' he says .
<s> group says mayor failed to rein in police during protests after michael brown 's 2014 death . </s> <s> mayor wo n't step down , saying `` there are ways to remove me '' </s><sec>ferguson , missouri -lrb- cnn -rrb- ferguson 's police chief and other city officials are already out . now some residents have told the missouri city they 'll try to oust the mayor , too . five residents friday filed an affidavit saying they 'll try to force a referendum on whether to remove mayor james knowles -- capping a tumultuous week in a community grappling not only with last year 's fatal shooting of teenager michael brown , but also wednesday 's wounding of two police officers shot during a protest . a group supporting the filing , organization for black struggle , a 35-year-old st. louis-based activist group , said the five would try to collect enough signatures -- 15 % of the city 's registered voters -- in the next 60 days . the five `` initiated recall -lrb- attempt -rrb- due to mayor knowles ' failure to adequately rein in an out-of-control police department during the protests following mike brown 's death , '' the activist group said . the city government acknowledged saturday that it received the affidavit . earlier this week , the police chief and the city manager resigned in the wake of a u.s. justice department report alleging institutionalized racism at just about every level of ferguson 's municipal government , including the police department . residents elect city council members , who in turn appoint the city manager . the city manager directs and supervises all city departments , including police . the top municipal court clerk was fired earlier in connection with racist emails . this month 's justice department report was initiated after one of ferguson 's police officers , darren wilson , shot and killed african-american teen michael brown in august , a shooting that spurred months of protests . wilson , a white officer who said he shot brown in self-defense , will not be charged in the case -- a grand jury declared it would n't indict him in november , and the justice department said this month that it would not bring federal civil rights charges in the case . wilson resigned from the department in november , citing security concerns . knowles indicated friday he wo n't be stepping down . `` i think it 's important to recognize that there 's a lot of people who may be angry at the situation ; there 's a lot of people who are frustrated in this community with the way things have gone down , '' the mayor , who is white , told cnn . `` but there 's a lot of people who still -- and who have expressed this to me -- express confidence in both my willingness , and members of the -lrb- city -rrb- council 's willingness , to listen , to be responsive , and to make changes as necessary , '' he continued . `` people in the community recognize this , now , not everybody . i did n't win every time with 100 % of the vote . but i can tell you there are ways to remove me if that is the will of the people , '' the mayor said . blake ashby , a white resident of ferguson , said friday that he believed knowles has `` consciously tried to reach out to all parts '' of the city of 21,000 people . `` if we lose mayor knowles , we lose a force for change , and it will be harder to make the changes that the doj -lrb- department of justice -rrb- is asking for , '' ashby said . rasheen aldridge , a black member of a commission charged with recommending reforms in ferguson , said that knowles needed to resign in the wake of the doj report . `` he knew what was going on during his watch , '' said aldridge , a member of the ferguson commission , which gov. jay nixon formed last year . investigators still are seeking breaks in the case of two police officers who were shot wednesday night during a protest in ferguson . while the demonstrators ' focus was ferguson , neither of the wounded officers works for that police department . one is from webster groves , a st. louis suburb 13 miles south of ferguson . the officer -- a 32-year-old with seven years ' experience -- was shot at the high point of his cheek , just under his right eye , police said . the other was hit in the shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back . he is a 41-year-old officer with the st. louis county police who has been in law enforcement for 14 years . both were treated and released . `` i can not tell you an arrest is imminent , and there 's certainly no one in custody , '' st. louis county police chief jon belmar told reporters friday afternoon . `` the detectives are working this investigation around the clock , and they will not rest until we have a conclusion in this investigation , '' the chief said . police have `` several leads , '' he said . `` i think we have a pretty good general idea of where we think the shots came from .

<s> the bodies of four italian tourists killed in tunis are returned to italy . </s> <s> the uncle and cousin of one of the suspected gunmen say they had no idea he had been radicalized . </s><sec>tunis -lrb- cnn -rrb- the bodies of four italian tourists slain in a terror attack on tunisia 's bardo museum three days ago arrived back in italy on saturday , an official with the tunis crisis center told cnn , but 14 victims ' remains still lie in the morgue . as tunisia gets back on its feet , the investigation into wednesday 's shooting at the tunis landmark continues . most of the 23 victims were foreigners , making the process of identification more complicated . nineteen of them were tourists who 'd been on two cruise ships that docked in tunis . french , spanish , italian , british , japanese , russian and colombian citizens are among those to have been formally identified so far . the bodies of the italians were met in rome by italian prime minister matteo renzi , who paid his respects to the victims and their families in a brief ceremony . eleven people who were injured in the attack remained in the hospital in tunisia on saturday , the official at the tunis crisis center said . tunisian prime minister habib essid identified two suspects in the attack , yassine labidi and saber khachnaou , in an interview with french radio station rtl on thursday , though it was n't immediately clear if they were the pair killed at the museum by tunisian security forces . he said yassine was `` known to the security services , he was flagged and monitored , '' but not known or being followed for anything special . authorities have arrested nine people in connection with the attack , including four directly linked to it , according to a statement from tunisian president beji caid essebsi . an uncle of yassine labidi , abeld malik labidi , told cnn on friday that no one he knew had seen any signs of extremism in his 26-year-old nephew . but he said yassine labidi was one of the two gunmen killed at the museum . `` it 's true that yassine carried out this terrorist attack , he was killed ; his head , his body , we do n't have it back , '' he said . but , he said , he believed yassine and other young tunisians like him were also victims of terrorism -- of the recruiters who paid them money , organized the logistics and took them to places like syria and libya to train as fighters . he had known his nephew well , he said . `` after the revolution of 2011 he started to pray , before he would drink beers from time to time , like a young tunisian . he was n't extreme in any way . '' the only thing that raised questions was that yassine had disappeared for about a month , he said . although his nephew said he 'd gone to the tunisian city of sfax to work , his family now suspected he had been in libya because of the phone numbers he called from . `` when he came back his behavior was the same : he was still himself , calm , serious . nobody noticed anything , even the neighbors i spoke to , '' said abeld malik labidi . `` he said hello to everyone , he prayed , he took his coffee , even on the day of the attack he took his coffee with his family and went to work . '' abeld malik labidi said yassine 's father , sister and brother had undergone lengthy interrogations by anti-terror police since the attack . officers had seized his nephew 's computer and phone , as well as taking samples of his fingerprints , he said . a cousin of yassine , who asked not to be named , told cnn that the family was shocked by what had happened . `` we are all shocked , we lost someone even if what he did was wrong , may god forgive him . those he killed were innocent , why would you go and harm australians or japanese ... our islam does n't mention about killing people , islam has never been this , '' he said . he also said he had no idea how his cousin had been radicalized , saying he was `` a normal tunisian guy ... but not an extremist . '' security minister rafik chelly said on friday that the two extremists who attacked the museum got weapons training at camps in libya . the suspects were activated from sleeper cells in tunisia , he said . he did not say which group activated them , or with whom they trained . `` they left the country illegally last december for libya , and they were able to train with weapons there , '' he told private broadcaster alhiwar ettounsi tv . like tunisia , libya saw its longtime leader moammar gadhafi ousted during the regional wave of revolutions known as the arab spring . but unlike its neighbor to the west , libya has been fraught with more instability and violence -- much of it perpetrated by islamist militants . in an audio message posted online thursday , isis claimed responsibility for wednesday 's attack , which it said targeted `` crusaders and apostates '' with `` automatic weapons and hand grenades . '' cnn can not independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement . that bloodshed is `` just the start , '' the isis message warned -- a threat that may or may not be hollow , but nonetheless adds extra urgency for tunisian investigators . cnn 's claudia rebaza reported from tunis and laura smith-spark wrote from london . cnn 's radina gigova and greg botelho contributed to this report .

'' jansrud has a 20-point lead over hannes reichelt in the downhill , but is less confident of overhauling his 52-point deficit on another austrian , three-time defending champion marcel hirscher , in the overall standings . the men next travel to slovenia for slalom events next weekend . `` i think he will gain some extra points in kranjska gora , so i 'm not very concerned about the overall , '' jansrud said of hirscher . `` i think he 'll pull through . but it might get exciting . he has no room for error and anything can happen .

<s> sens. cornyn and klobuchar : trafficking stealing kids ' childhoods . </s> <s> two bills introduced to combat problem passed judiciary committee , they say . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- melissa was sold into the sex trade by a family member when she was only 12 years old . her life became a prison : chained to a bed in a warehouse , she endured regular beatings , rapes and once was even set on fire by her captors as she was forced to serve 5 to 30 men every day . the experience was enough for her to wish she was dead . and this all took place in texas -- right here , in our own country . melissa miraculously escaped her captors but , as is the case with so many other victims , she struggled for years to distance herself from her past , even finding herself in jail on multiple occasions . and while institutionalized slavery has long been cast from america 's history books , thousands of children still suffer from the bonds of sex trafficking . indeed , with the average age of a victim only 13 years old , these horrific crimes are stealing the innocent childhoods of kids across america . and the problem is n't confined to one part of the country . in , minnesota , for example , a 12-year-old girl received a text message that she thought was from a friend . it invited her to go to a party and asked her to go to a fast food restaurant nearby . but she did n't get to a party . instead , she was taken to a hotel and raped by a 34-year-old pimp , forced to take explicit photos of herself that were then posted on craigslist , before being forced to have sex with two more men who saw the post . these heartbreaking stories demonstrate what is broken about our current system , and why we both feel committed to fixing it . instead of treating people like these young girls as the victims they are , they are often thrown into the criminal justice system , labeled prostitutes and left with few options but to return to a nightmare that shockingly still exists in the united states . meanwhile , instead of treating their perpetrators as child rapists and traffickers , they are often simply treated as `` johns '' who , if caught , often pay a fine and go on their way . this is outrageous , and should not be tolerated any longer . that is why we 've joined forces with more than 200 advocacy groups to fight this modern-day slave trade and provide hope and opportunity for its victims . two bills we have introduced to combat this horrific crime recently passed the senate judiciary committee with strong support and will have the opportunity for consideration by the senate . the justice for victims of trafficking act -lrb- jvta -rrb- would support victims by taking fines and criminal assets from convicted human traffickers and directing them toward services and treatment to help victims restore their lives . the jvta does n't only help victims , it also arms law enforcement with more tools to go after human traffickers . it ensures these criminals , including `` johns , '' are brought to justice under our laws , because a financial transaction should not mask assault on a child . the second bill is modeled after minnesota 's `` safe harbor '' law , which helps make sure minors sold for sex are n't prosecuted as defendants , but are instead treated as victims . the stop exploitation through trafficking act -lrb- sett -rrb- would give incentives for all states to have a safe harbor provision . when a state passes a safe harbor law , it means that kids sold for sex are steered towards child protection services , rather than being arrested , charged , or convicted under a state 's criminal statutes . all across the country , from texas to minnesota , young people are being robbed of their innocence and subjected to unthinkable horrors and abuse . we must do everything we can to free them from the shackles of sex trafficking . we must join together and take action to combat this modern-day slavery once and for all .
