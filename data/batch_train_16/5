'' witnesses put the death toll from the day 's clashes at 19 , including ethiopian troops , insurgents and civilians . ethiopian troops arrived in somalia in december 2006 to help a weak somali government drive the islamic courts union out of mogadishu and restore a u.n.-backed transitional government after a decade and a half of near-anarchy . the islamists responded by launching an insurgency against somali government and ethiopian troops that has lasted nearly a year . the united states accused the icu of harboring suspected al qaeda figures , including three men wanted in the 1998 bombings of u.s. embassies in tanzania and kenya , and raised no objections to ethiopian presence in somalia . washington has long been concerned that somalia could turn into a safe haven for terrorists , but icu leaders denied harboring al qaeda suspects . e-mail to a friend .

'' asked which government programs they would cut , paul said bringing the troops home from iraq would save `` a trillion dollars . '' mccain said : `` it 's that kind of isolationism that caused world war ii , '' which drew some hoots from the crowd . watch mccain , paul spar on iraq '' paul replied : `` the real question you have to ask is why do i get the most money from active duty officers and military personnel ? '' a retired brigadier general , keith kerr , who is gay , asked candidates if they thought u.s. military personnel were professional enough to work with gay and lesbian troops . cnn later learned that a june media release from the campaign of democratic front-runner clinton listed kerr as a member of its steering committee for gay and lesbian supporters . watch kerr deny that the clinton campaign influenced his question '' david bohrman , cnn senior vice president and executive producer of the debate , said , `` we regret this incident . cnn would not have used the general 's question had we known that he was connected to any presidential candidate . '' political ticker . kerr told cnn after the debate that he has not worked for the clinton campaign and was representing no one other than himself . kerr also said he is a member of the log cabin republicans , a national gay and lesbian republican grass-roots organization . prior to the debate , cnn had verified kerr 's military background and that he had not contributed money to any presidential candidate . in a section of the debate about gun ownership rights , three of the gop presidential hopefuls said they do not own guns : mccain , giuliani and romney . former tennessee sen. fred thompson quipped , `` i own a couple of guns -- but i 'm not going to tell you what they are or where they are . '' watch the candidates address gun control '' the debate turned personal when a viewer , holding the bible , asked : `` do you believe every word of this book ? and i mean specifically , this book that i am holding in my hand . '' huckabee , a baptist minister , said , `` sure , i believe the bible is exactly what it is . '' giuliani said he believes the bible , but not `` literally true in every respect . '' after that , romney stammered a bit when moderator anderson cooper asked him if he believed every word . watch the candidates get personal about the bible '' `` yeah , the bible is the word of god . ... i might interpret the word differently than you interpret the word , but i read the bible and i believe the bible is the word of god , '' romney said . when asked about abortion , romney said he was wrong in favoring a woman 's right to choose -- his position when he was elected governor of massachusetts . `` if people in this country are looking for someone who 's never made a mistake on a policy issue and is not willing to admit they 're ever wrong , they 're going to have to find somebody else . on abortion , i was wrong , '' he said . his remarks came in response to the 30-second video produced for the debate by thompson 's campaign , which included a clip of romney expressing support for roe vs. wade during a 1994 debate against sen. ted kennedy . when asked what women and doctors should be charged with if abortion was to become illegal , paul said it was not an issue for the president or the federal government . `` we do n't need a federal abortion police , that 's the last thing we need , '' paul said . he added that the issue should be left to the states and courts and not federal authorities . on the issues of taxes , thompson said he 'd `` never met a tax he liked . '' `` i 've got a tax-cut bill on the table . but i do n't do pledges to anybody but the american people , '' he said . his response was met by a `` go , fred , go ! '' from a member of the audience . on the issue of trade with china , rep. duncan hunter said china is `` cheating on trade ... and it 's in the interest of the united states to stop china 's cheating . buy american this christmas season -- that might keep your neighbor from losing his job . '' the candidates fielded video questions submitted by the public via the youtube web site , just as democratic white house candidates did in july . the debate was the first time the gop candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month . cnn 's political team viewed nearly 5,000 videos for the gop debate -- about 2,000 more than they saw for the democrats ' debate . e-mail to a friend .

'' the group called the operation `` another successful conquest and a second epic that the knights of faith have dictated with their blood , defending the wounded islamic nation and in defiance to the crusaders and their agents , the slaves of america and the sons of france . '' at least 10 u.n. staffers were among those killed , according to u.n. spokeswoman marie okabe . the offices of the un high commissioner for refugees -- located across the street from the u.n. headquarters -- were leveled by a blast that struck about 9:30 a.m. -lrb- 3:30 a.m. et -rrb- tuesday . `` our offices are basically destroyed now , nothing works , '' unhcr spokesman ron redmond said from its geneva headquarters . watch his full interview . he said rescuers are working into the night trying to get to the trapped u.n. workers . `` it 's a very serious situation still with the u.n. in algiers , '' he said . in a strongly worded statement , u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon condemned what he called `` an abjectly cowardly strike against civilian officials serving humanity 's highest ideals under the u.n. banner . '' `` the perpetrators of these crimes will not escape the strongest possible condemnation -- and ultimate punishment -- by algerian authorities and the international community , '' ban said in the written statement . he said he has sent senior advisers and other top u.n. officials to head to algiers to assist in the investigation and rescue effort . most of those killed in the coordinated attacks were victims of the first suspected car bombing near the constitutional council -- which oversees elections -- and supreme court in the algiers neighborhood of ben aknoun , according to the state-run algeria press agency . that blast struck a bus outside the targeted building , killing many of those on board , the news agency reported . one man said he heard the first blast then the second exploded in front of him . `` i saw the trees falling and the glass shattering in front of me . i had to run away from the car , '' he said . zerhouni said the attack was the work of the salafist group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , the same group that took responsibility for an attack in april in downtown algiers that killed 33 people . that group also uses the name al qaeda islamic maghreb after merging with al qaeda earlier this year . it abandoned small-scale attacks in favor of headline-grabbing blasts after it joined with al qaeda . cnn international security correspondent paula newton said the merger combined the expertise of algerian guerrillas with the operational ability of al qaeda in north africa , enabling the group to penetrate the usually extensive security in high-profile areas of algiers . she said the group 's goal is to destabilize countries like algeria , morocco and tunisia , which it sees as enemies of the islamic state . zerhouni said police interrogations of gspc members arrested in the wake of the april attack revealed that algeria 's constitutional council and supreme court were on a list of gspc targets . algeria , which has a population of 33 million , is still recovering from more than a decade of violence that began after the military government called a halt to elections which an islamist party was poised to win . tens of thousands of people died in the unrest . although the country has remained relatively peaceful , recent terrorist attacks have raised fears of a slide back to violence . e-mail to a friend .

'' `` this is a bipartisan bill supported by over 50 republicans , '' obey , d-wisconsin , said in a statement issued after the veto . `` there has been virtually no criticism of its contents . it is clear the only reason the president vetoed this bill is pure politics . '' bush said democrats are supporting $ 22 billion in additional spending beyond his budget proposals this year and $ 205 billion over five years -- money he said would ultimately be raised by tax increases . `` when the bill for all that spending comes due , congress is going to turn to the working people , to the small-business owners and the entrepreneurs , '' he said . tuesday 's veto is the fifth cast since democrats took control of congress in 2006 . congress has overridden one of those , voting last week to authorize $ 23 billion in water projects nationwide over the president 's objections . democrats will schedule another override vote this week , an aide to house majority leader steny hoyer said . but antonia ferrier , spokeswoman for house republican whip roy blunt , said bush 's gop allies are confident they will be able to sustain the veto . bush signed a $ 470 billion pentagon spending bill that covers the defense department 's normal operations , but democrats split $ 50 billion in spending for the wars in iraq and afghanistan off into a `` bridge fund '' to which they plan to attach demands for bush to withdraw u.s. combat troops . the measure sets up another confrontation with the white house . bush also demanded congress reform the alternative minimum tax -- a measure originally aimed at preventing the wealthy from evading taxes , but one that increasingly affects middle-class earners -- without raising additional revenue . he said a plan proposed by rep. charles rangel , the democratic chairman of the house ways and means committee , to eliminate the tax was unacceptable . `` preventing a tax increase in one area should not be an excuse for raising taxes in other areas , '' he said . `` congress should eliminate the tax increases in the bill and send the amt relief to my desk as soon as possible . '' the elimination of the tax would cause an estimated $ 800 billion to be lost over 10 years . to replace that , rangel 's bill would add a 4 percent surtax on individual incomes over $ 100,000 , after deductions , and close corporate tax loopholes . the bill also would cut rates for many individual and corporate taxpayers . republicans have already started calling it `` the mother of all tax increases . '' `` with all the other pressures on our economy , raising taxes is one of the most unwise things congress could possibly do , '' bush said . bush acknowledged the difficulties americans face from high fuel prices , a `` challenged '' housing market and `` uncertainty '' in financial markets stemming from the collapse of the subprime mortgage market -- `` but as we have seen in recent years , this economy is resilient , and that 's important for the american people to understand .

'' the transfer took place january 26 , the indictment alleges . oakley is also charged with converting the material and `` restricted data '' to his own use . he began doing so on about october 17 , 2006 , and continued through january , prosecutors said . prosecutors said the materials involved have been examined by scientists and posed no threat to people who may have come into contact with them . oakley 's attorney , herb moncier , said outside court thursday that oakley 's job was to break rods `` into little pieces '' and throw them away . moncier said oakley had a security clearance , but moncier did not believe it was a high-level clearance . the government alleges that in january , oakley attempted to sell the `` pieces of scrap '' to someone he thought was a french agent -- but in reality was an undercover fbi agent , moncier said . he said he questions whether those broken pieces would be considered an `` appliance '' under the law . `` mr. oakley has cooperated fully for the last six months , '' said moncier , who added that he had traveled to washington for work on the case . each count carries a possible sentence upon conviction of up to 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine . `` while none of the stolen equipment was ever transmitted to a foreign government or terrorist organization , the facts of this case demonstrate the importance of safeguarding our nuclear technology and pursuing aggressive prosecution against those who attempt to breach the safeguards and put that technology in the wrong hands , '' kenneth wainstein , assistant attorney general for national security , said in the justice department statement . one government source said the materials involved are not the `` crown jewels , '' but they should not have been taken from the facility . a `` barrier '' is used to filter uranium during the enrichment process , according to nuclear energy officials , but a significant number of barriers are needed to do that job . sources told cnn that federal authorities have been following oakley and investigating the case for at least six months , after he allegedly tried to sell the classified material . oakley , described as a low-level employee , apparently did not make contact with any foreign government and is not a foreign agent of any kind , an official familiar with the case said . a government official with with knowledge of the case said that when authorities learned of oakley 's alleged intentions six months ago , the fbi and department of energy launched a joint investigation . the fbi then developed a sting operation , government officials familiar with the case said , and authorities intervened before there could be any involvement of a foreign country . east tennessee technology park is an area of the doe 's oak ridge reservation `` where we are currently decontaminating and decommissioning buildings that were last used in 1985 , '' gerald boyd , manager of the doe 's oak ridge site office , said thursday . `` when they were in use , now over 20 years ago , some of the buildings at ettp housed facilities used for the enrichment of uranium .
