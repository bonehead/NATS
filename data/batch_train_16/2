<s> re-designed fuji speedway to host its first japanese grand prix since 1977 . </s> <s> suzuka to alternate with fuji from 2009 . </s> <s> computer models used to prepare teams for the unfamiliar circuit . </s><sec>london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- there are some circuits that are cornerstones of the formula 1 calendar : the monacos and silverstones whose every twist and turn are known intimately by the drivers and engineers . then there are the newer circuits -- malaysia and bahrain , for instance -- but even these have become familiar to the drivers and their backroom boffins . fuji speedway employees pose behind a scale model of the new circuit and in front of an overhead view . next week they have something completely new to contend with : a track that has yet to see a single f1 team put in a single lap . the japan grand prix is to return to the fuji speedway , a circuit that has n't seen an f1 race since 1977 -lrb- though now with a substantially different track layout -rrb- . the fuji circuit will be familiar to fans of classic arcade games . the old fuji speedway was the setting for the 1982 arcade game pole position -lrb- released by namco in japan and atari in the rest of the world -rrb- . the most notable aspect of the circuit is the vision of mount fuji , japan 's tallest mountain , looming in the distance . though the move to this picturesque location is not without its controversies . the suzuka track -- which had held japanese grands prix between 1987 and 2006 -- had been popular with drivers and fans alike , but for this year and the next the japanese grand prix will be held at fuji . however an announcement by formula one management -lrb- fom -rrb- this month revealed that suzuka will return to the calendar for 2009 -- on the condition that the circuit makes some approved modifications -- with the location of the japanese grand prix alternating yearly between fuji and suzuka after that . behind the scenes is a political battleground -- both circuits are owned by car manufacturers with f1 connections -- honda owns suzuka , toyota owns fuji . toyota is a relative newcomer to f1 but , having this year surpassed general motors as the world 's number one automobile manufacturer , and reputedly having the best funded team in the paddock -lrb- a position that has n't been reflected in sporting success -rrb- , it is not without clout . the redesign of the fuji track was carried out by hermann tilke in 2003 . tilke , a german architect redesigned a number of f1 circuits in the 1990s and has since designed many new grand prix tracks including malaysia , istanbul , bahrain and shanghai , and the tracks for 2008 's debut grands prix in singapore and valencia . so how do f1 teams prepare for a new circuit such as fuji without data from previous races to fall back on ? the answer lies with computer simulation . computer-aided design -lrb- cad -rrb- is as much a part of the design of a circuit these days as it is a part of the design of the high-tech cars . every bend , every straight and every camber is fastidiously analyzed on screen before an ounce of dirt is shifted on the ground itself . despite never having raced on the circuit , the teams have been testing their cars on a virtual fuji speedway for some time . bmw sauber 's simulation experts received cad data from the japanese race organizers late last year . and when their cars arrive at fuji for testing next week , their race set-up should be close to optimum . the circuit was analyzed and broken up into between 500 and 800 segments . the radius of each individual segment was measured , allowing the engineers to exactly calculate the optimum racing line -lrb- the route around the circuit that covers the shortest possible distance -rrb- . then the effects of factors such as gradients and inclines were calculated . the slightest change in angle of a gradient can have significant effects on the downforce and aerodynamic profile of a car . `` in order to avoid losing precious time during the race weekend , we need to have as accurate as possible a picture of downforce levels , gearbox ratios and brake specification in advance , '' says willy rampf , technical director of the bmw sauber f1 team . dieter glass , chief race and test engineer with toyota f1 explains : . `` you start to determine what downforce level gives the best lap time on the new circuit . once you know that , you look into which gear ratios suit the track with the given level of downforce , before you get into more detailed simulations of different set-up solutions . `` getting a bit closer to the weekend , you start running race simulations in order to predict the optimum race strategy . this prediction takes into account estimates of relevant characteristics of the new track , like the degradation of the two bridgestone tire compounds and the effect the fuel has on lap time . if you have more fuel in the car , this affects your lap time , but we can accurately predict how much time is lost with every extra kilogram of fuel carried . '' one peculiarity of the fuji circuit is the exceptionally long main straight , which at 1.475 km -lrb- 0.916 miles -rrb- will allow for higher-than average-straight line speeds but , after the straight the track is relatively twisty . the teams have to find a balance between getting the most speed into the straight , and the best grip decelerating into the bends . `` you have some very slow corners which require good mechanical grip , '' says glass , `` and as always you want good grip in general , but you have to balance that with the long straight , where you need low enough downforce to get a level of drag which allows you to have a good top speed . '' the testing may be virtual , but the teams hope that these virtual figures are a hair 's breadth away from real world eventualities : . `` our aim is to ensure that the lap times and top speed calculated using the simulation software do not vary by more than one percent from the actual values , '' says rampf . not that everything can be predicted : `` i think we are quite accurate but the ultimate response to that is very difficult to say for sure because it very much depends on what happens in the race , '' continues glass . `` many incidents can happen , which then have a positive or an adverse affect on strategy .

<s> some witnesses say colorado does nothing to protect them . </s> <s> one witness spent over 10,000 dollars on security after being terrorized . </s> <s> community activist says colorado 's witness protection program is `` a joke '' </s><sec>denver , colorado -- a colorado man terrorized by threats after testifying against his daughter 's abusive boyfriend says he has spent $ 10,000 on a security system , hired a bodyguard for his son 's wedding and never leaves home without a .45 - caliber handgun strapped to his chest . keith reynolds was convicted for witness intimidation after threatening witnesses in his domestic assault case . the man , who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case , says the state did nothing to protect him after the 1999 conviction of keith reynolds for domestic abuse -- even after prosecutors told him a hit had been put on his family . a report in the denver post pointed out major problems protecting witnesses in the state of colorado . paul logli , chairman of national district attorneys association , told congress this year that witness intimidation has become `` almost epidemic , '' according to the denver post . when asked if prosecutors had made the family aware of colorado 's witness protection program , the witness in the reynolds case said , `` all they told us was maybe we should move . '' `` i 'm pretty sure i told one of them -- either him or his wife -- about the program . i ca n't remember if i gave them all the details . '' the prosecutor assigned to the case , who did n't want to be named , told cnn . after reynolds ' conviction , the witness and his wife saw strange cars parked outside their home . they received phone calls during which the only sound on the other end of the line was a gun being cocked . the couple received a death threat from reynolds himself through the mail . watch witness describe fear of being targeted '' reynolds was then sentenced to ten years in a maximum security prison for witness intimidation . however , it is likely he 'll be released within five years . no national statistics on crimes against witnesses exist , and minimal research has been conducted on the subject . the latest national institute of justice survey on record -- conducted more than a decade ago -- shows that more than half of big city prosecutors consider witness intimidation a major problem . colorado has $ 50,000 allocated to its witness protection budget . in contrast , the city of denver spent almost $ 100,000 on landscaping last year . the state , on average , spends about $ 1,000 per witness . that figure supposedly includes moving expenses , rent , and furniture . the federal program spends in excess of $ 40 million per year on witness protection . one possible reason for the disparity is that witnesses in state cases do not get new identities , as do federal witnesses . `` it 's not designed to be a long-term relocation at the public 's expense ; it 's a way to ensure the immediate safety of the witnesses , '' according to peter weir , executive director of the colorado department of public safety . colorado 's witness protection program is a `` joke , '' according to the rev. leon kelly , founder and executive director of the open door youth gang alternatives . kelly says the state does n't provide enough incentive for witnesses to come forward . more than a decade ago , a young man named darryl givens asked kelly for advice while deciding whether to testify in a murder case or face prison . givens chose to testify . a few months later , he was shot twice in the head by men he considered friends . that day continues to haunt kelly . rhonda fields says failures in the witness protection program may have contributed to her son 's murder . javad fields was a college graduate who was engaged to be married . he had plans to move east when a fourth of july barbecue in 2004 in changed all that . he witnessed the murder of his best friend and subsequently testified against three men suspected in the killing . javad fields and his fiancee were gunned down while driving along a suburban street in aurora , colorado . the couple , both 22 , died instantly . rhonda fields says her son was never told about a witness protection program . she confronted prosecutors after his murder . fields told cnn , `` i asked them what happened . why were n't any measures taken to safeguard his life ? and i was told he never asked for any protection . '' javad 's mother does not think it was her son 's responsibility to ask for protection . `` i think it 's the authorities ' responsibility to notify witnesses of the dangers that are involved with being a witness , '' she said . field 's case illustrates glaring weaknesses in the witness protection program . prosecutors filed an order for protection requesting javad fields ' personal information be kept secret , but it was n't signed by a judge until one year later , after defense lawyers had already given the suspects fields ' personal information , along with crucial trial documents . `` i felt like the da 's office used my son to win their case but did not take the proper measures to safeguard his life , '' rhonda fields told cnn . district attorney carol chambers maintains the program has improved . she says a notice about witness protection is now attached to every subpoena , ensuring witnesses are aware of their options . that did n't start , however , until two years after javad fields was killed . e-mail to a friend .

'' new information turned up during the investigation also raised questions about the death of peterson 's third wife , kathleen savio , which was ruled an accident by a coroner 's jury , glasgow said . `` there are strong indications that it was a homicide , '' he said . `` that 's why we are doing the exhumation , because there are tests that need to be done that were n't done during the first autopsy . '' watch why authorities want to exhume the body '' glasgow cited abrasions on savio 's body and a gash on her head that could not be readily explained . `` our main thrust is to determine whether or not it was a homicide , and as we do that , we will see if there is any evidence that implicates anyone , '' he said . glasgow , who was not state attorney at the time of savio 's death , said he reviewed the case file before deciding to reopen the case . `` with 29 years of experience , there was no doubt in my mind it was n't an accident , '' he said . `` that was clear . '' in 2002 , savio was charged once with battery and once with domestic battery against her husband , but was found not guilty at trial , glasgow said . another time , she tried to bring domestic battery charges against peterson , but no charges were ever filed . savio 's sister , sue doman , said savio expressed fear of drew peterson . `` she told me all the time , ` he 's gon na kill me . it 's gon na look like an accident , ' '' doman said . doman said she did n't believe her sister could have died in the way the investigation concluded . `` i do n't understand accidental drowning . you just do n't drown in the bathtub , especially a small whirlpool . you just do n't do that , '' she said . meanwhile , friends and family of stacy peterson said she expressed concerns about her husband . a friend , steve cesare , has told cnn he received e-mail from her describing her relationship as abusive . the woman 's aunt , candace aikin , of el monte , california , said stacy peterson confided in her that there were problems during a visit to the peterson home in suburban chicago last month . `` she said that she was afraid because he was following her around 24/7 , even inside the house , '' aikin said . `` he was very obsessed and stalking her , even inside her house . she was very , very full of stress and just not happy in her marriage at all , '' aikin said . e-mail to a friend .

'' nichols responded , `` that is what we believe , yes . '' watch simpson transferred sunday in handcuffs '' the alleged victims were identified as bruce fromong , a sports memorabilia collector who described the incident as `` a home invasion-type robbery , '' and alfred beardsley , who has been quoted by celebrity web site tmz.com as saying that simpson later apologized to him and told him he regretted the incident . acting on a tip , police met over the weekend at mccarran international airport with 46-year-old walter alexander , of mesa , arizona , who told them about the alleged robbery and validated the tipster 's information , capt. james dillon told reporters . alexander was arrested saturday night on two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon , two counts of assault with a deadly weapon , conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary with a deadly weapon . he was released on his own recognizance and returned to mesa either saturday night or early sunday morning , dillon said . in addition , investigators are seeking four other men they believe accompanied simpson into the hotel room , nichols said . nichols said , `` there is a social relationship between the individuals that we identified and o.j. simpson . '' though simpson is not accused of having brandished a gun himself , two firearms that police said were used were recovered early sunday in one of three searches . investigators would would not divulge where the weapons were found . nichols dismissed an initial report that the men may have been off-duty police . `` there is no truth to that whatsoever , '' he said . `` that came as a result of some language that was used when the individuals burst into the room that led our victims to believe that they may have been police . '' simpson , 60 , has acknowledged taking some items that belonged to him , but he has denied that any weapons were involved . `` whether the property belonged to mr. simpson or not is still in debate , '' nichols said . `` we are still in the process of sorting that out . '' nichols also said that some of the property taken had simpson 's signature . but `` there was some other property taken as well , '' he said . `` i believe there were some joe montana cleats and some signed baseballs and other stuff . '' the latest charges against simpson mean he faces the prospect of another prosecution , more than a decade after the june 1994 stabbing deaths of his ex-wife , nicole brown simpson , and ron goldman . simpson was acquitted of murder the following year . the trial riveted much of the united states . but in 1997 , a jury found him liable for the deaths in a civil case brought by the goldman family . simpson was ordered to pay the families a total of $ 33.5 million for the deaths . goldman had gone to nicole simpson 's los angeles home to return a pair of glasses the day of the slayings . goldman 's sister , kim goldman , said she was n't surprised by the robbery allegations , since simpson `` thinks he can do no wrong . '' `` he 's capable of stabbing people to death , so i think robbery is nothing surprising , '' she said . `` normal , logical , civil-minded , law-abiding people do n't storm a room with guns demanding stuff back . '' fromong had testified on simpson 's behalf in the civil case , telling the court that prices for simpson memorabilia had dropped substantially since the 1995 verdict . his testimony was part of the defense 's contention that simpson could not afford to pay the goldmans . simpson recently wrote a book originally titled `` if i did it '' and had planned to publish it himself , but a public outcry led to the cancellation of his book deal . a bankruptcy judge subsequently awarded the goldmans the rights to the book in light of their inability to collect the wrongful death award . the goldmans retitled the book , `` if i did it : confessions of the killer .

' '' although it began accidentally -lrb- when he was short an actor for the film `` the lodger '' -rrb- , hitchcock soon made it his egotistical trademark to appear in his own films , amassing a total of 37 cameos throughout his career . ayn rand . the egotist 's egotist , author ayn rand -lrb- born alissa zinovievna rosenbaum -rrb- is the patron saint of thinking you 're better than everybody else . her most famous novels , the fountainhead and atlas shrugged , are massive dramatizations of objectivism , her self-spun oscar-the-grouch philosophy for success . objectivism champions ego and accomplishment , shuns all religion as folly , and condemns any form of charity or altruism as counterproductive to society . rand 's novels often focus on protagonists -lrb- invariably men -rrb- who are shunned by others because of their genius , but then persevere over the foolishness of morons to prove said genius and emerge triumphant . not surprisingly , she saw humility as a weakness and regarded laughing at yourself as `` spitting in your own face . '' so , just how much did rand believe in her own philosophy ? let 's just say a lot . with signature modesty , she ranked herself as the philosophical equal of aristotle and thomas aquinas . orson welles . when you create a cinematic masterpiece such as `` citizen kane '' at the ripe old age of 25 , you 're bound to get a big head . but welles was convinced of his own importance much earlier than that . in fact , `` citizen kane '' might have been sparked by nothing more than a bruised ego . after all , it 's said he devised the film as a withering exposé of newspaper mogul william randolph hearst because hearst slighted welles at a dinner party . of course , after the unparalleled success of `` citizen kane , '' welles 's arrogant side did n't get any less subtle . do yourself a favor : track down a recording of welles ' outtakes for a tv commercial for frozen peas . you 'll hear everything you need to know about the filmmaker 's oversized ego . a classic quote goes : `` in the depths of your ignorance , what is it you want ? '' frank lloyd wright . as the brains behind the robie house , fallingwater , taliesin west , the guggenheim , and countless other design benchmarks , frank lloyd wright is arguably the genius of 20th-century architecture . and , boy , did he know it ! wright was notorious for believing he was superior to mere mortals . in fact , the architectural egomaniac frequently acted as though the rules -- even those of geography and climate -- did not apply to him . but when you 're wright , you 're right . in 1935 , department store magnate stanley marcus -lrb- of neiman-marcus fame -rrb- commissioned the architect to design his dallas home , but the project quickly went sour . wright 's avant-garde floor plan included `` sleeping porches '' that required his client to sleep outdoors year-round . in addition , marcus ' small bedroom `` cubicles '' came equipped with almost no closet space . when stanley respectfully explained that -lrb- a -rrb- temperatures during summer nights in dallas often exceed 80 degrees and -lrb- b -rrb- a high-fashion tastemaker might need bigger closets , wright threw a series of tantrums . fortunately for the voyeur in us all , said tantrums usually took place in letter form . preserved and occasionally displayed at the dallas museum of art , they make for delicious reading . salvador dalí . `` every morning when i awake , the greatest of joys is mine : that of being salvador dalí . '' yup , he actually said that . everything about the legendary surrealist painter -lrb- he of the melting clocks -rrb- -- from his whacked-out paintings to his curled-up mustache -- was designed to shock , destroy convention , cause scandal , and stir controversy . criticized for choosing to live under general franco 's fascist government in spain , dalí defended his position by stating that he did n't care about others so long as he could be king . not exactly a man of the people . if he was n't getting enough attention , he was known to walk the streets of new york city clanging a hand bell . of course , this is also the guy who once said , `` the thought of not being recognized -lsb- is -rsb- unbearable . '' need another telling quote ? `` at the age of 6 years , i wanted to be a chef . at the age of 7 , i wanted to be napoleon . my ambitions have continued to grow at the same rate ever since . '' apparently , so did his ego . al jolson . plenty of performers this side of gallagher have been labeled `` the world 's greatest entertainer . '' but al jolson really , really believed it . the vaudeville singer , actor , dancer , and comedian was born asa yoelson in seredzius , lithuania , in what was then part of imperial russia . as a performer , he was known for hijacking the action in the middle of shows , ad-libbing , or just stopping to talk to the audience . during a 1911 performance of the critically hated `` paris is a paradise for coons '' -lrb- title not edited for political correctness -rrb- , jolson stopped and asked the audience if they 'd rather hear him sing than see the rest of the play . the crowd roared with applause , and jolson ditched the whole program and took over . from that moment on , no one else could share the stage with him . unlike some of the egomaniacs on this list , however , jolson can be forgiven somewhat for his arrogance . according to most contemporary accounts , he actually was the greatest in the world . but , despite the enormity of his contributions to stage and screen , jolson 's legacy has become a political hot potato because of his use of stage blackface -lrb- considered highly offensive now , but pretty common at the time -rrb- . e-mail to a friend . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .
