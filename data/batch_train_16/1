's world food program said . the united states has offered more than $ 2 million as an initial contribution for emergency relief , and sent two u.s. navy carriers to help in recovery operations . in addition , the u.s. agency for international development -lrb- usaid -rrb- is airlifting in relief supplies and an 18-person department of defense medical team is in bangladesh helping the estimated 15,000 injured by the storm . bangladesh 's government held an emergency cabinet meeting saturday to assess the disaster and discuss recovery issues , bangladeshi government spokesman fahim munaim told cnn . officials fear the scope of the destruction may be much more extensive since there are remote areas where conditions can not yet be determined . munaim said nearly a third of bangladesh 's 64 districts were affected by the cyclone , most of those along the southern coast . the bangladeshi military is working to provide shelter for the many people who have been displaced . international aid groups -- including save the children , world vision , and the red crescent , which already have offices in bangladesh -- are deploying resources to the cyclone-stricken region but -- like the government -- they have found it nearly impossible to reach the more remote areas to assess conditions . roads to remote areas are either blocked by massive trees fallen by the storm , or so severely damaged that it is impossible for vehicles to use . clearing could take weeks in the remote areas because it must be done by hand -- there are no chainsaws and modern machinery to speed up the process . along the broken road that leads into kolapara , the body of an 8-year-old girl called rummie was carefully carried away for burial . overwhelmed with sadness , her mother khadija was steadied by a relative . `` i am feeling too much pain in my heart , '' she said . `` i have lost my daughter , so i am a victim of the cyclone as well .

'' she repeats several times , making sure the message is clear and waving away jordanian pupils attracted by the commotion . dozens of girls in green apron-like uniforms pour out into the courtyard and cluster on the top level of a stone staircase overlooking a concrete playground . harb wants the cnn crew to see how many iraqi refugee girls her school is accommodating . this school year , she says , 145 students are iraqi -- roughly 20 percent of the students at this state-funded institution -- with another 40 iraqi children on a waiting list . watch iraqi girls describe a long way from home '' the reason behind the jump in the number of iraqis at the school is a new government policy : for the first time since the start of the iraq war , jordan is allowing all iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to enroll in state-funded schools . simply , this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked . the move is cementing a massive population shift in the middle east . more than 2.2 million iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland , most of them seeking refuge in neighboring jordan and syria , according to humanitarian officials . jordanian minister of education khalid touqan says he expects jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 iraqi students this year . that 's more than double the number of iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago . harb , on the front line of the phenomenon , says the influx is putting a strain on her school . even with some u.n. and u.s. aid to jordan , there 's still not enough money . `` we need more teachers here , more resources , more buildings , more chairs for all iraqi students and our students , '' she says . in a nearby neighborhood , in the study room of the ahmed toukan school for boys , a handful of iraqi kids talk of their experience living far from home . seated at a rectangular table covered with a red and white tablecloth , the boys tell stories of horror and displacement . eighteen-year-old qutaiba lost five immediate family members before moving to jordan to try to live a normal life . matter-of-factly and with a straight-ahead stare , he repeats the number : `` five members . '' most of the boys and young men from iraq have missed several years of school -- up to a four-year educational gap that will delay not only their high school graduation , but also their entry into the workforce . all say , though , that they feel lucky to have gotten out , even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move , ready to live far from home and away from loved ones . `` it 's not strange for me to be in the middle of people i do n't know , '' says eleventh grader ziad tarek al shamsi . `` i had friends in iraq when i was small , i left them . in america , i left them . i came here , i left them . '' he pauses : `` but you have to miss your country . '' the united nations high commissioner for refugees estimates up to 250,000 school-age iraqi children are in jordan . many of them are enrolled in private institutions . but as families run out of money they had when they left iraq , they turn to public schools . even so , more than a month into the new academic year , fewer iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year . according to the charity save the children , 21,000 iraqi children have so far enrolled in jordanian classrooms . as a result , the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for iraqi families . the lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees ' fears of being identified through their children 's school records . regardless of what the final number will be this year , the population shift in the middle east is , according to unhcr head antonio guterres , the largest urban refugee situation in the world . iraqi families are changing the social fabric of jordanian society . about 10 percent of jordan 's population is now made up of iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to 750,000 of them . the schoolchildren are living examples of how the iraq war may permanently change the middle east . `` iraqi children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of education , '' says touqan , the education minister . `` we will not run a parallel system of education .

'' she repeats several times , making sure the message is clear and waving away jordanian pupils attracted by the commotion . dozens of girls in green apron-like uniforms pour out into the courtyard and cluster on the top level of a stone staircase overlooking a concrete playground . harb wants the cnn crew to see how many iraqi refugee girls her school is accommodating . this school year , she says , 145 students are iraqi -- roughly 20 percent of the students at this state-funded institution -- with another 40 iraqi children on a waiting list . watch iraqi girls describe a long way from home '' the reason behind the jump in the number of iraqis at the school is a new government policy : for the first time since the start of the iraq war , jordan is allowing all iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to enroll in state-funded schools . simply , this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked . the move is cementing a massive population shift in the middle east . more than 2.2 million iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland , most of them seeking refuge in neighboring jordan and syria , according to humanitarian officials . jordanian minister of education khalid touqan says he expects jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 iraqi students this year . that 's more than double the number of iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago . harb , on the front line of the phenomenon , says the influx is putting a strain on her school . even with some u.n. and u.s. aid to jordan , there 's still not enough money . `` we need more teachers here , more resources , more buildings , more chairs for all iraqi students and our students , '' she says . in a nearby neighborhood , in the study room of the ahmed toukan school for boys , a handful of iraqi kids talk of their experience living far from home . seated at a rectangular table covered with a red and white tablecloth , the boys tell stories of horror and displacement . eighteen-year-old qutaiba lost five immediate family members before moving to jordan to try to live a normal life . matter-of-factly and with a straight-ahead stare , he repeats the number : `` five members . '' most of the boys and young men from iraq have missed several years of school -- up to a four-year educational gap that will delay not only their high school graduation , but also their entry into the workforce . all say , though , that they feel lucky to have gotten out , even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move , ready to live far from home and away from loved ones . `` it 's not strange for me to be in the middle of people i do n't know , '' says eleventh grader ziad tarek al shamsi . `` i had friends in iraq when i was small , i left them . in america , i left them . i came here , i left them . '' he pauses : `` but you have to miss your country . '' the united nations high commissioner for refugees estimates up to 250,000 school-age iraqi children are in jordan . many of them are enrolled in private institutions . but as families run out of money they had when they left iraq , they turn to public schools . even so , more than a month into the new academic year , fewer iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year . according to the charity save the children , 21,000 iraqi children have so far enrolled in jordanian classrooms . as a result , the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for iraqi families . the lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees ' fears of being identified through their children 's school records . regardless of what the final number will be this year , the population shift in the middle east is , according to unhcr head antonio guterres , the largest urban refugee situation in the world . iraqi families are changing the social fabric of jordanian society . about 10 percent of jordan 's population is now made up of iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to 750,000 of them . the schoolchildren are living examples of how the iraq war may permanently change the middle east . `` iraqi children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of education , '' says touqan , the education minister . `` we will not run a parallel system of education .

'' the leadership blamed republican members of congress for stalling the funding for the veterans programs by blocking its inclusion in the larger spending bill . perino , though , said the democrats could still send a separate bill to the president funding the veterans program that passed both chambers of congress . `` the democrats decided not to send the president this bill , '' perino said . `` that has to be laid at their feet .

<s> colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees . </s> <s> scientists suspect a virus may combine with other factors to collapse colonies . </s> <s> disorder first cropped up in 2004 , as bees were imported from australia . </s> <s> $ 15 billion in u.s. crops each year dependent on bees for pollination . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a virus found in healthy australian honey bees may be playing a role in the collapse of honey bee colonies across the united states , researchers reported thursday . honey bees walk on a moveable comb hive at the bee research laboratory , in beltsville , maryland . colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees -- up to 90 percent of colonies in some u.s. beekeeping operations -- imperiling the crops largely dependent upon bees for pollination , such as oranges , blueberries , apples and almonds . the u.s. department of agriculture says honey bees are responsible for pollinating $ 15 billion worth of crops each year in the united states . more than 90 fruits and vegetables worldwide depend on them for pollination . signs of colony collapse disorder were first reported in the united states in 2004 , the same year american beekeepers started importing bees from australia . the disorder is marked by hives left with a queen , a few newly hatched adults and plenty of food , but the worker bees responsible for pollination gone . the virus identified in the healthy australian bees is israeli acute paralysis virus -lrb- iapv -rrb- -- named that because it was discovered by hebrew university researchers . although worker bees in colony collapse disorder vanish , bees infected with iapv die close to the hive , after developing shivering wings and paralysis . for some reason , the australian bees seem to be resistant to iapv and do not come down with symptoms . scientists used genetic analyses of bees collected over the past three years and found that iapv was present in bees that had come from colony collapse disorder hives 96 percent of the time . but the study released thursday on the science express web site , operated by the journal science , cautioned that collapse disorder is likely caused by several factors . `` this research give us a very good lead to follow , but we do not believe iapv is acting alone , '' said jeffery s. pettis of the u.s. department of agriculture 's bee research laboratory and a co-author of the study . `` other stressors on the colony are likely involved . '' this could explain why bees in australia may be resistant to colony collapse . `` there are no cases ... in australia at all , '' entomologist dave britton of the australian museum told the sydney morning herald last month . `` it is a northern hemisphere phenomenon . '' bee ecology expert and university of florida professor jamie ellis said earlier this year that genetic weakness bred into bees over time , pathogens spread by parasites and the effects of pesticides and pollutants might be other factors . researchers also say varroa mites affect all hives on the u.s. mainland but are not found in australia . university of georgia bee researcher keith s. delaplane said thursday the study offers a warning -- and hope . `` one nagging problem has been a general inability to treat or vaccinate bees against viruses of any kind , '' said delaplane , who has been trying to breed bees resistant to the varroa mite . `` but in the case of iapv , there is evidence that some bees carry genetic resistance to the disorder . this is yet one more argument for beekeepers to use honey bee stocks that are genetically disease - and pest-resistant . '' bee researchers will now look for stresses that may combine to kill bees . `` the next step is to ascertain whether iapv , alone or in concert with other factors , can induce ccd -lsb- colony collapse disorder -rsb- in healthy bees , '' said ian lipkin , director of the center for infection and immunity at columbia university mailman school of public health . besides the columbia and usda researchers , others involved in the study released thursday include researchers from pennsylvania state university , the pennsylvania department of agriculture , the university of arizona and 454 life sciences . e-mail to a friend .
