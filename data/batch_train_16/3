'' here , inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they 're ready to appear in court . most often , they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer -- charges that judge steven leifman says are usually `` avoidable felonies . '' he says the arrests often result from confrontations with police . mentally ill people often wo n't do what they 're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid , delusional , and less likely to follow directions , according to leifman . so , they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed , but not getting any real help because they 're in jail . we toured the jail with leifman . he is well known in miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill . even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards , we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor . go inside the ` forgotten floor ' '' at first , it 's hard to determine where the people are . the prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes . imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that 's kind of what they look like . they 're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves . that 's also why they have no shoes , laces or mattresses . leifman says about one-third of all people in miami-dade county jails are mentally ill . so , he says , the sheer volume is overwhelming the system , and the result is what we see on the ninth floor . of course , it is a jail , so it 's not supposed to be warm and comforting , but the lights glare , the cells are tiny and it 's loud . we see two , sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes , sometimes naked , lying or sitting in their cells . `` i am the son of the president . you need to get me out of here ! '' one man shouts at me . he is absolutely serious , convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the white house . leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system , occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital , only to return to jail to face their charges . it 's brutally unjust , in his mind , and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in miami . over a meal later , we talk about how things got this way for mental patients . leifman says 200 years ago people were considered `` lunatics '' and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them . they were just considered unfit to be in society . over the years , he says , there was some public outcry , and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals . but leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down . where did the patients go ? nowhere . the streets . they became , in many cases , the homeless , he says . they never got treatment . leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals , and today that number has been reduced 90 percent , and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals . the judge says he 's working to change this . starting in 2008 , many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the `` forgotten floor '' will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment , not just punishment . leifman says it 's not the complete answer , but it 's a start . leifman says the best part is that it 's a win-win solution . the patients win , the families are relieved , and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again . and , for leifman , justice is served . e-mail to a friend .

'' stone said the releases would continue at the same pace beyond ramadan . stone 's description seems a far cry from the abu ghraib prison operated by the u.s. military in the first years after the invasion . that prison was closed down and razed in the wake of an international scandal over prisoner abuse . `` there are no secrets that go on in detention , '' stone said . `` our facilities are open to inspection by any agency that we in the federal government believe is credible . these agencies are welcomed because they are windows for the world . '' see what life 's like inside camp cropper 's walls '' by the time of their release , `` detainees grow in terms of working in an inter-sectarian environment , '' he said . each detainee has a chance to take classes up to a sixth-grade level , and high school classes are being planned , stone said . about one-third -- or 8,000 -- are in school , with 7,000 having passed the fifth-grade level , he said . the 860 detainees who are 17 or younger are all in school , stone said . the average stay for a detainee is 300 days , but some have been detained for two years or longer , he said . a review board interviews detainees to decide if they are a threat to security , he said . if they are deemed not to be , they are offered freedom in exchange for taking the pledge . only 280 detainees are foreigners , mostly from syria , egypt , iran , sudan and saudi arabia , he said . other developments .

'' he said the bush administration , the state department and congress all share blame . speaking with military reporters in virginia , sanchez also said such dereliction of duty by a military officer would mean immediate dismissal or court martial , but the politicians have not been held accountable . `` i 'm astounded , really , '' south carolina republican sen. lindsey graham on cnn 's `` late edition '' with wolf blitzer on sunday . graham , who recently returned from baghdad , said he and gop presidential candidate sen. john mccain had visited sanchez several times in 2003 and 2004 . `` every time we talked to gen. sanchez , we got pushback -- we have enough troops ; guard and reserves are n't being strained , '' graham said . he added that sanchez 's own record in iraq is blemished : abu ghraib `` got out of control under his watch . the war in general got out of control under his watch .

'' if that does not happen , he said , `` it will be incumbent upon us , as a nation , to devise a new political strategy to find a way forward or create a stable iraq . '' that brought a blistering response from zbigniew brzezinski , national security adviser under president carter . `` what is this ? this is a colony , '' he said . `` that 's the heart and essence of the difficulties we encounter . '' even those iraqis who were happy to see saddam hussein toppled from power more than four years ago are not happy with the continuing u.s. presence , brzezinski said . though some countries are willing to go along with the united states , `` no one in the world really supports our policy in iraq , '' he said . in his friday speech , sanchez added that the `` surge '' of u.s. troops into iraq represents `` a desperate attempt by the administration that has not accepted the political and economic realities of this war . '' national security council spokeswoman kate starr did not address the comment . instead , she said , `` we appreciate his service to the country . as gen. petraeus and ambassador crocker said , there 's more work to be done but progress is being made in iraq . and that 's what we 're focused on now .

'' it 's the perception that the country is becoming more hispanic , that spanish is replacing english , that hispanic immigrants are weakening american identity , and that main street is turning into little mexico . a leader of the vigilante minuteman movement moronically called it the `` colonization '' of the united states . this sort of rhetoric is all about fear -- that those who thrive in the dominant culture are losing their primacy , that the mainstream is being polluted by foreigners , and that our children are going to live in a world where they 're going to have to work a lot harder to keep up . it conjures up the alarm bells that benjamin franklin set off about german immigrants in the late 18th century , who he insisted could never adopt the culture of the english , but would `` swarm into our settlements , and by herding together establish their language and manners to the exclusion of ours . '' it popped up in the mid-19th century amid worries that chinese immigrants were `` unassimilable , '' which led to congress approving the explicitly-named chinese exclusion act of 1882 . and it helped welcome the 20th century when massachusetts sen. henry cabot lodge warned that immigrants -lrb- read : the irish -rrb- were diluting `` the quality of -lrb- u.s. -rrb- citizenship '' and others complained that italian immigrants were uneducated , low skilled , apt to send all their money to their home country and prone to criminal activity . where have we heard that before ? and when will we hear it again ? after all , hispanics may be the latest group to find themselves in a culture war with nativists . but they wo n't be the last . ruben navarrette jr. is a member of the editorial board of the san diego union-tribune and a nationally syndicated columnist . you can read his column here . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer . e-mail to a friend .

<s> amount almost double what was spent in 2004 election cycle . </s> <s> lower tv production costs help more candidates advertise . </s> <s> mitt romney leads presidential candidates in tv spending . </s> <s> advertisers face challenge of cutting through clutter of ads , analyst says . </s><sec>washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a wide-open presidential race and a willingness by candidates , interest groups , unions and corporations to buy tv time will lead to historic spending for political and issue-advocacy advertising in the 2008 election cycle , an analysis shows . former massachusetts gov. mitt romney has spent the most on tv advertising so far among presidential contenders . the cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $ 3 billion , according to tns media intelligence/campaign media analysis group , cnn 's consultant on political television advertising . this is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issue-advocacy television advertising rang in at $ 1.7 billion . in 2006 , $ 2.3 billion was spent on political and issue-advocacy tv commercials . just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money , said evan tracey , cmag 's chief operating officer . the costs to produce a tv commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates , who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters . see how spending breaks down for this year '' and interest groups have spent $ 6.2 million on tv ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures . on the national level , the cost of issue-advocacy television ad spending was $ 270 million in the first nine months of this year . subjects ranged from the iraq war to telecommunications reform . television ads on health care alone total $ 60 million . cmag estimates more than $ 3 million of the $ 270 million spent to air issue-advocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive house and senate races in 2008 . tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups `` pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode . '' `` what we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries , and through the general election , is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates , '' he said . with 17 democratic and republican candidates running for president , cmag predicts that more than $ 800 million will be spent on tv ads in the battle for the white house . up to now , the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of iowa , new hampshire and south carolina . voters in some of the 20-plus states holding nominating contests on february 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months . former massachusetts gov. mitt romney leads all candidates in tv spending , having aired his commercials more than 11,000 times this year at a cost of nearly $ 8.6 million . this is a record for the number of airings at this point in a presidential election cycle . watch how romney is way ahead in ad spending '' in contrast , one of romney 's chief rivals for the gop nomination , former new york mayor rudy giuliani , has spent nothing on television ads , but giuliani leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state surveys . giuliani enjoys widespread national name recognition , while romney does not . in the race for the democratic nomination , illinois sen. barack obama has spent more than $ 2.3 million on television commercials , while new york sen. hillary clinton has spent $ 1 million less and leads in both national and early state polls . new mexico gov. bill richardson has probably benefited the most in the democratic contest from the $ 2 million he has invested in his television commercials . richardson 's humorous tv ads effectively stated his experience as a lawmaker , diplomat and executive , and positioned him as a solid second-tier candidate . romney used his $ 8.6 million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to republican voters . these voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal massachusetts . romney is leading polls in the early voting states of iowa and new hampshire . further evidence of how romney 's television commercials have helped is in south carolina . an american research group poll of south carolina republicans in august showed romney registering at 9 percent with these influential primary voters . a month later , and with $ 350,000 worth of commercials aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll , romney was up 17 percentage points . romney 's latest ad began airing friday in iowa , and in it he vows to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons , to boost the military by 100,000 people , to strengthen u.s. intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the u.s. from al qaeda . all of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the iowa caucuses . while only a handful of democratic candidates and romney have used the airwaves until now , tracey said he expects this to change . `` before the end of october , i suspect all the frontrunner candidates will be on the air , '' tracey said . `` as we get closer to primary day , the frontrunners will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last , best shot . '' in the fight for congress , cmag predicts that as much as $ 639 million could be spent on television advertising . democrats control the house and senate . tracey noted that cmag 's 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account unforeseen events such as former florida rep. mark foley 's house page scandal or the september 11 terrorist attacks . `` politics is completely beholden to events , '' he said . `` events will ultimately determine how much is spent , where and when . '' what television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming months ? `` chances are , just as what happened in 2006 , voters will be numb after watching hundred and hundreds of ads , '' said stuart rothenberg , editor of the non-partisan rothenberg political report . `` the sheer number of ads probably dilutes their importance . after a while , the ads just become lots of chatter and an ad will have to be really good to cut through the noise .

'' the suspension makes `` a strong statement that conduct which tarnishes the good reputation of the nfl will not be tolerated , '' he said in a statement . watch what led to vick 's suspension '' goodell said the falcons could `` assert any claims or remedies '' to recover $ 22 million of vick 's signing bonus from the 10-year , $ 130 million contract he signed in 2004 , according to the associated press . vick said he would plead guilty to one count of `` conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and to sponsor a dog in an animal fighting venture '' in a plea agreement filed at u.s. district court in richmond , virginia . the charge is punishable by up to five years in prison , a $ 250,000 fine , `` full restitution , a special assessment and 3 years of supervised release , '' the plea deal said . federal prosecutors agreed to ask for the low end of the sentencing guidelines . `` the defendant will plead guilty because the defendant is in fact guilty of the charged offense , '' the plea agreement said . in an additional summary of facts , signed by vick and filed with the agreement , vick admitted buying pit bulls and the property used for training and fighting the dogs , but the statement said he did not bet on the fights or receive any of the money won . `` most of the ` bad newz kennels ' operations and gambling monies were provided by vick , '' the official summary of facts said . gambling wins were generally split among co-conspirators tony taylor , quanis phillips and sometimes purnell peace , it continued . `` vick did not gamble by placing side bets on any of the fights . vick did not receive any of the proceeds from the purses that were won by ` bad newz kennels . ' '' vick also agreed that `` collective efforts '' by him and two others caused the deaths of at least six dogs . around april , vick , peace and phillips tested some dogs in fighting sessions at vick 's property in virginia , the statement said . `` peace , phillips and vick agreed to the killing of approximately 6-8 dogs that did not perform well in ` testing ' sessions at 1915 moonlight road and all of those dogs were killed by various methods , including hanging and drowning . `` vick agrees and stipulates that these dogs all died as a result of the collective efforts of peace , phillips and vick , '' the summary said . peace , 35 , of virginia beach , virginia ; phillips , 28 , of atlanta , georgia ; and taylor , 34 , of hampton , virginia , already have accepted agreements to plead guilty in exchange for reduced sentences . vick , 27 , is scheduled to appear monday in court , where he is expected to plead guilty before a judge . see a timeline of the case against vick '' the judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement . the federal case against vick focused on the interstate conspiracy , but vick 's admission that he was involved in the killing of dogs could lead to local charges , according to cnn legal analyst jeffrey toobin . `` it sometimes happens -- not often -- that the state will follow a federal prosecution by charging its own crimes for exactly the same behavior , '' toobin said friday . `` the risk for vick is , if he makes admissions in his federal guilty plea , the state of virginia could say , ` hey , look , you admitted violating virginia state law as well . we 're going to introduce that against you and charge you in our court . ' '' in the plea deal , vick agreed to cooperate with investigators and provide all information he may have on any criminal activity and to testify if necessary . vick also agreed to turn over any documents he has and to submit to polygraph tests . vick agreed to `` make restitution for the full amount of the costs associated '' with the dogs that are being held by the government . `` such costs may include , but are not limited to , all costs associated with the care of the dogs involved in that case , including if necessary , the long-term care and/or the humane euthanasia of some or all of those animals . '' prosecutors , with the support of animal rights activists , have asked for permission to euthanize the dogs . but the dogs could serve as important evidence in the cases against vick and his admitted co-conspirators . judge henry e. hudson issued an order thursday telling the u.s. marshals service to `` arrest and seize the defendant property , and use discretion and whatever means appropriate to protect and maintain said defendant property . '' both the judge 's order and vick 's filing refer to `` approximately '' 53 pit bull dogs . after vick 's indictment last month , goodell ordered the quarterback not to report to the falcons training camp , and the league is reviewing the case . blank told the nfl network on monday he could not speculate on vick 's future as a falcon , at least not until he had seen `` a statement of facts '' in the case . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's mike phelan contributed to this report .
