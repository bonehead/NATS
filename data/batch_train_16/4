'' the scene is an old people 's home . two residents are playing beggar my neighbor . enter the princess . the question from the royal visitor is unexpected but everyone laughs . afterwards they comment on her large eyes and what life she brought into the room . one tiny incident , characteristic of countless other occasions in the princess 's public life in which she found the right word or the right gesture to bring cheer and comfort . everyone here will have their own memories . i remember meeting princess diana for the very first time early in 1981 to discuss details of the wedding service in st paul 's . even archbishop 's chaplains have their share of proper diffidence and i was nervous entering the presence . it must have been a bewildering time for the princess as well , but even then , at the age of 20 , her capacity for empathy and her very strong intuitive power ensured that any tension soon evaporated . prince harry has spoken movingly and justly , as few others have the right to do , about the princess as a mother . i want to dwell for a moment on her public work , its cost and its meaning . after her marriage , the princess joined her natural gifts of beauty , empathy and powerful intuition with that extraordinary charge which association with the royal family generates . led by our queen and other members of the royal family , our constitution has developed in response to the challenges of the past century . there is a properly political sphere in which the monarch may counsel but does n't intrude , but there is another sphere , vital to any sense of national unity and creativity , a sphere in which communities must be celebrated , common values articulated and the transcendent source of those values honored . we tend to be suspicious of public figures who wrap themselves in divinity and claim that their will is god 's will , but if no-one can articulate in an un-ignorable way in the public realm the creative energy of the love that we see in christ , the human face of god , then we shall find ourselves inhabiting a maimed and diminished society . and at a time when people are suspicious of rhetoric , the monarchy communicates by symbol and by simple speech , and the princess brought her own gifts to this work . she was still only 26 in 1987 when she shook the hand of a patient at the opening of the middlesex hospital 's aids ward . it was the first in the uk and it is very hard now to credit the degree of fear and prejudice which surrounded aids in the '80s . those familiar with the field have no doubt that the princess played a significant part in overcoming a harmful and even a cruel taboo in a gesture which was not choreographed but sprung from a deep identification with those who were vulnerable and on the margin . and she had a similar impact in the usa . an editorial in the new york times in 1989 admitted ruefully that it had taken a foreign , and even a royal , dignitary to draw attention to a major public health concern in the us . her work in the very last year of her life for the victims of landmines also caught the popular imagination internationally and certainly accelerated the adoption of the ottawa convention , banning the use of a weapon which disproportionately kills and maims women and children . she proved the eloquence of embrace and of touch which , of course , have been used by royal healers throughout the centuries . and as she said , in her words , `` the biggest disease today is not leprosy or tb but the feeling of being unwanted '' . she sought out places of suffering , because they are so very often places of truth where the masks have been removed , and she was not afraid to be with the dying and to comfort them in an unsentimental way . bill deedes accompanied her on some of her visits . his response to the cynics was typically robust . he said : `` she was one who sought above all to help vulnerable people in society and who did it so well . she was good at this because she herself was vulnerable . she knew the feeling . she did n't set out to be a saint . '' the role brought great power but , like any member of the royal family , she also experienced the weight of expectation and the intensity of the scrutiny . honoring but managing the role and not allowing it to take over one 's personal humanity is a desperately difficult task . as we have heard from prince harry , his mother diana did all that she could to prepare her sons for the work which lies ahead . she confessed to receiving a very great deal from some of those whose lives she touched . she said of john , a young greek suffering from cystic fibrosis : `` he showed no sign of anger , no trace of bitterness but touched us all with an aura of optimism and hope for the future such that i have never before encountered . '' the love of christ described in the lesson read by prince william contains the essence of the spiritual life . princess diana recognized this quality of life in many of those , like john , whose lives she touched . it was a mystery which resonated deeply with her and for which she reached out . and the mystery is this - the more you go beyond yourself , the more you will become your true self ; the more you lose yourself in loving and serving others , the more you will find yourself ; the more you keep company with those who suffer , the more you will be healed . this is the knowledge which passes all understanding . this is certain and has been proved experimentally in the life of all the saints . it 's easy to lose the real person in the image , to insist that all is darkness or all is light . still , 10 years after her tragic death , there are regular reports of `` fury '' at this or that incident , and the princess 's memory is used for scoring points . let it end here . let this service mark the point at which we let her rest in peace and dwell on her memory with thanksgiving and compassion . let us also , echoing the words of prince harry , look to the future and pray , in the words of st paul , for all those who serve our country as members of the royal family and most especially for the sons who were so precious to her : . `` i pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power with all the saints to grasp what is the breadth and length and depth and height of the love of christ and to know this love which surpasses knowledge that you might be filled with the fullness of god .

'' concerned citizens have helped troops improve security in parts of baghdad , a military official says . people line the streets , cars congest them , trash collectors and other city workers have returned , local leaders are holding community meetings again and `` markets have come back like gangbusters , '' said army col. don farris , commander of 2nd brigade combat team , 82nd airborne division . he added that the largely sunni al qaeda in iraq presence has been `` crushed '' since the beginning of may . however , there are still dangers , most notably the threats posed by iranian-backed shiite militants , farris said . speaking to pentagon reporters via video link from baghdad , farris cited several factors he said contributed to the improving security situation . among them is the `` surge , '' the additional u.s. troops deployed earlier this year . watch how old rivalries have been posing problems '' also helping improve the security situation are the cease-fire by radical shiite cleric muqtada al-sadr 's mehdi army and the development of a program that employs `` concerned local citizens '' to assist u.s. and iraqi forces , farris said . some of those citizens are members of local sunni `` awakening councils , '' comprised of former militants -- often armed -- who create neighborhood watch groups to root out the insurgent elements in an area . especially in the last six weeks , farris said , civic and religious leaders have seen outsiders operating in the area and troops have made arrests , two iranian operatives among them . `` from my foxhole , in our sector , it is working , '' he said of the improving security in the area . `` i can only speak to what i see in my sector and i am encouraged . '' farris ' sector -- which includes the sunni-dominated district of adhamiya and sadr city , the shiite slum where militants have demonstrated a strong presence -- has seen a `` remarkable turnaround , '' he said . many of the communities in his area have been wracked with sectarian warfare and terrorized by insurgents and death squads . despite improvements in the security situation , farris warned that `` we still have a lot of work to do '' because there does n't appear to be any sign that shiite extremists with links to iran are halting their activities . farris said troops also are still finding explosively formed penetrators , which are often delivered or manufactured by iran . nine such bombs were found in late october , he said . there are intelligence reports indicating weapons and money are still flowing into sadr city , he said . there are also problems returning refugees and displaced people to their homes in the area , farris said , because `` essential services '' like water and electricity are not yet up to snuff . though a `` trickle '' of families has returned home and many are asking when they can return , farris said he believes residents will return en masse only when basic services are in better shape . paul folmsbee , a state department provincial reconstruction team leader , said at the same news conference that his personnel was handling development issues involving law , governance , economic development and essential services . farris ' monday remarks echo a string of similar assertions made by u.s. and iraqi military officials over recent weeks . the military officials say they are seeing signs of sunni-shiite reconciliation . at a press conference earlier monday in baghdad , brig. gen. ed cardon , deputy commander for support of multi-national division-center , discussed a `` definite period of progress '' in his region on the southern baghdad outskirts . e-mail to a friend .

'' he praised moore for raising awareness of the issue . however , gupta said he was concerned that the movie -- which notes that other developed nations such as france and canada have universal health care -- suggests that health care in those countries is free . while patients may not pay for services at the doctor 's office , they do pay high taxes to fund such a system , something gupta said he was concerned that `` sicko '' audiences might not realize . moore responded by saying americans pay more in copays , deductibles and insurance premiums . `` we -lsb- america -rsb- have a system built on profit , '' the moviemaker said . he asked gupta if the current system , which requires him to receive approval from an insurance company before performing some procedures , is cumbersome to him . `` it 's a shameful system , especially when i 'm dealing with some of my patients , '' gupta said . but he questioned moore 's apparent solution -- putting health care in the hands of the bush administration , which moore fiercely criticized in the past , particularly in his film `` fahrenheit 9/11 . '' `` the government actually used to do things right , '' moore said in response . `` the problem is who we put in power . '' moore has adamantly opposed the war in iraq and said the government should reprioritize -- a position he took many years before skepticism of the war 's success abounded in washington . `` i am sorry we 've taken so much time trying to correct -lsb- gupta 's -rsb- facts here tonight instead of talking about the real issue '' -- the ailing health care system , moore said . e-mail to a friend .

'' the shooting appeared to have been planned out in graphic videos posted on internet file-sharing site youtube . at a news conference this afternoon , police confirmed the dead numbered two girls , five boys and the school 's headmistress at jokela high in tuusula , a quiet town around 50 kilometers -lrb- 30 miles -rrb- north of helsinki . ten other people were taken to a hospital with minor injuries . the shooter , whom police identified as pekka eric auvinen , died at toolo hospital , authorities said . police said he took his own life . it was the first school shooting in finland since 1989 , when a 14-year-old student shot and killed two others in the coastal town of rauma , the finnish news agency stt reported . police said auvinen is from tuusula and who acted alone . he had no previous criminal record and had never threatened anyone from the school before , they added . auvinen published a manifesto online demanding war on the `` weak-minded masses '' and pledged to die for his cause . watch auvinen fire weapons in video from his web page '' youtube appeared to have removed 89 videos linked to his account , many of them featuring nazi imagery , shortly after the incident . finnish media reported someone posted a message two weeks ago on the web site , warning of a bloodbath at the school . a video posted earlier wednesday , by `` sturmgeist89 , '' was titled `` jokela high school massacre - 11/7/2007 . '' `` sturmgeist89 '' identified himself as auvinen , and said he chose the name `` sturmgeist '' because it means `` storm spirit '' in german . the video showed a picture of the school , which then disintegrated to reveal two images of auvinen against a red background , pointing a gun at the screen . the clip is accompanied by the song `` stray bullet '' from rock band kmfdm . eric harris and dylan klebold , the students behind the 1999 columbine high school massacre , also cited that group 's lyrics . another short video clip , called `` just testing my gun , '' showed auvinen loading and cocking a handgun . he fired and hit several pieces of fruit in a wooded area ; the camera then showed a close-up of the destroyed fruit , and then a full-screen shot of him again . he waved at the camera and then walked out of view . the site indicated that the youth appeared to be fascinated with killing . as well as video footage of the columbine school shootings , it also included clips of the 1993 waco siege in the united states , the 1995 sarin gas attack in tokyo , and bombs falling on baghdad during the 2003 invasion . many showed victims being wheeled away or people running for their lives . throughout all of this , the single word `` die '' constantly flashed across the screen . other video clips included nazi-war-criminal footage . in the rambling text posted on the site , auvinen said that he is `` a cynical existentialist , anti-human humanist , anti-social social-darwinist , realistic idealist and god-like atheist . `` i am prepared to fight and die for my cause , '' he wrote . `` i , as a natural selector , will eliminate all who i see unfit , disgraces of human race and failures of natural selection .

<s> if you build it , the tourists will come to your museum . </s> <s> museums for hobos , medical oddities and trash . </s> <s> kentucky museum is where dummies go to die . </s><sec>-lrb- mental floss -rrb- -- 1 . the spam ® museum . spam marks its 70th anniversary in 2007 which is also the chinese year of the pig . if the on-site `` wall of spam '' is any indication , a tour through the spam museum in austin , minnesota , is guaranteed fun for the whole canned-pork-loving family . spam 's parent company , hormel foods , opened the establishment in 2001 to the tune of almost 5,000 cans of spam . one of the main attractions is a scale model of a spam plant , where visitors can don white coats and hairnets while pretending to produce america 's favorite tinned meat . 2 . national museum of funeral history . it 's pretty hard to argue with the motto `` any day above ground is a good one . '' so goes the backhanded optimism of the national museum of funeral history , a houston facility that opened in 1992 . visitors are treated to exhibits that include a civil war embalming display and a replica of a turn-of-the-century casket factory . in addition , the museum boasts an exhibit of `` fantasy coffins '' designed by ghanaian artist kane quaye . these moribund masterpieces include a casket shaped like a chicken , a mercedes-benz , a shallot , and an outboard motor . according to quaye , his creations are based on the dreams and last wishes of his clients , which -- let 's be honest -- really makes you wonder about the guy buried in the shallot . 3 . the hobo museum . if you 're bumming around but looking for a good time , be sure to take a load off in britt , iowa , at the hobo museum , which details the history and culture of tramps . bear in mind , though , that the museum kind of , well , slacks on hours and is only open to the public during the annual hobo convention . luckily , tours can be arranged by appointment any time of year . of course , if you 're interested in the hobo convention , lodging is available all over the area , but it 's a safe bet that most of your compatriots will be resting their floppy hats at the `` hobo jungle , '' located by the railroad tracks . both the event and the museum are operated by the hobo foundation , which -- incidentally -- also oversees the nearby hobo cemetery , where those who have `` caught the westbound '' are laid to rest . 4 . the mütter museum . originally , the college of physicians of philadelphia erected the mütter museum as a creative way to inform medical students and practicing physicians about some of the more unusual medical phenomena . -lrb- you know , babies with two heads , that sort of thing . -rrb- . but today , it primarily serves as a popular spot for anyone interested in the grotesque . there , you 'll find the world 's largest colon , removed from a man who died -- not surprisingly -- of constipation . also on display : an ob-gyn instrument collection , thousands of fluid-preserved anatomical and pathological specimens , and a large wall dedicated entirely to swallowed objects . 5 . the barnum museum . what better way to honor `` greatest show on earth '' founder p.t. barnum than with a mediocre museum in bridgeport , connecticut ? some visitors will appreciate the museum 's ridiculously detailed miniature model of a five-ring circus . but only circus freaks -lrb- and by that we mean `` enthusiasts '' -rrb- will get a kick out of seeing a stale piece of cake from the wedding of barnum 's 40-inch-tall sidekick , general tom thumb . 6 . the conspiracy museum . there 's more than one theory about the assassination of john f. kennedy , so why not have more than one museum devoted to it as well ? most jfk buffs are familiar with the sixth floor museum housed in the former texas school book depository , which recounts all those boring `` mainstream '' details of the late president 's life leading up to his death at the hands of lee harvey oswald . but just down the street , the conspiracy museum offers fodder for those less apt to buy into the man 's propaganda . for the most part , the museum specializes in showings of the zapruder film and explanations of contrary assassination theories , including other gunmen on the grassy knoll and possible mafia involvement . 7 . the museum of questionable medical devices . take two trips to the museum of questionable medical devices and call us when you 've lost all faith in the medical profession . thanks to curator bob mccoy -lrb- who recently donated the collection to the science museum of minnesota -rrb- , those in search of history 's quack science can find what they 're looking for in the st. paul tourist attraction , whether it 's a collection of 19th-century phrenology machines or some 1970s breast enlargers . if you make the trip , be sure to check out the 1930s mcgregor rejuvenator . this clever device required patrons to enclose their bodies , sans head , in a large tube where they were pounded with magnetic and radio waves in attempts to reverse the aging process . 8 . cook 's natural science museum . what began as a training facility for cook 's pest control exterminators blossomed into one of the few museums in the country willing to tell the tale of the pest . at cook 's natural science museum in decatur , alabama , visitors can learn everything they ever wanted to know about rats , cockroaches , mice , spiders , and termites ... all for free . and while most people would rather step on the live specimens than learn about them , museum exhibits such as the crowd-pleasing pest of the month keep reeling in patrons . 9 . vent haven ventriloquist museum . so , what do you get when you combine the loneliness of a pet cemetery with the creepy flair of vaudeville ? the vent haven ventriloquist museum , of course -- where dummies go to die . the fort mitchell , kentucky , museum was the brainchild of the late william shakespeare berger , who founded the site as a home for retired wooden puppets . in fact , he collected figures from some of the country 's most famous ventriloquist acts . and with more than 700 dummies stacked from floor to ceiling , you 're bound to feel like you 're stuck inside a 1970s horror flick -- albeit a really good one . but sadly , when berger gave the tour , you could totally tell his mouth was moving . 10 . the trash museum . mom was n't kidding when she said one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . at the trash museum in hartford , connecticut , the connecticut resources recovery authority -lrb- crra -rrb- turns garbage into 6,500 square feet of pure recycling entertainment ! t . our the temple of trash or visit the old-fashioned town dump . and for your recycler-in-training , head across the state to the children 's garbage museum , where you can take an educational stroll through the giant compost pile , get a glimpse of the 1-ton trash-o-saurus , or enjoy the company of resident compost worms . e-mail to a friend . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .
