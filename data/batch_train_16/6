<s> several famous songs written by men for a woman . </s> <s> beethoven 's `` für elise '' may have been written `` for therese '' </s> <s> songwriters make up stories about who is behind `` 867-5309 / jenny '' </s><sec>1 . `` für elise '' bob dylan wrote `` it ai n't me , babe '' for joan baez . written by : ludwig van beethoven . written for : some girl probably not named elise . in fact , as far as most historians can tell , beethoven did n't even know an elise . instead , the song was originally titled `` bagatelle in a minor '' based on some handwritten notation a beethoven researcher claimed to have seen on a now-lost copy of the sheet music . further complicating things , beethoven had hideous handwriting -- to the point that some scholars speculate the song was actually written `` for therese , '' as in therese malfatti , one of several women who turned down a marriage proposal from the notoriously lovesick maestro . 2 . `` philadelphia freedom '' written by : elton john & bernie taupin . written for : billie jean king , as a thank-you for a tracksuit she gave elton . and what a tracksuit it must have been ! the 1975 song remains one of the most popular disco hits ever , leaving thousands of hustle enthusiasts wondering just what billie jean king had to do with philadelphia , anyway . turns out , the song was a reference to king 's pro tennis team , the philadelphia freedoms . prior to 1968 , tennis players were all considered `` amateurs '' and were n't eligible to receive prize money . so , if you did n't have the wealth to support yourself , you could n't play . billie jean king fought against those constraints , ultimately founding professional world team tennis in 1974 and turning tennis into a paid league sport . 3 . `` lola '' written by : the kinks ' ray davies . written for : a transvestite . but the question is , which one ? according to rolling stone , `` lola '' was inspired by candy darling , a member of andy warhol 's entourage , whom ray davies briefly -lrb- and cluelessly -rrb- dated . if that 's the case , then `` lola '' is just another notch on darling 's song belt -- she 's also referred to in lou reed 's `` walk on the wild side . '' -lrb- `` candy came from out on the island / in the backroom she was everybody 's darlin ' . '' -rrb- . but , in the kinks ' official biography , davies tells a different story . he says `` lola '' was written after the band 's manager spent a very drunken night dancing with a woman whose five o'clock shadow was apparently obvious to everyone but him . 4 . `` 867-5309 / jenny '' written by : jim keller -lrb- of tommy tutone -rrb- and alex call . written for : unknown , as the songwriters apparently make up a different story about its inspiration every time they 're asked . while the woman continues to remain a mystery , however , the phone number is all too real . in fact , it 's been wreaking havoc ever since 1982 and the passage of time has n't quelled of the number of crank calls . in 1999 , brown university freshman roommates nina clemente and jahanaz mirza found that out the hard way , when the school adopted an 867 exchange number for its on-campus phone system . immediately , the girls ' innocuous room no. 5309 became a magnet for every drunk college kid with a 1980s fetish . other unfortunate phone customers have fought back with creative and profitable solutions , like the holder of 212-867-5309 , who put his phone number up for auction on ebay in 2004 . bids approached $ 100,000 before ebay pulled the item at the request of verizon , the number 's actual owner . 5 . `` oh , carol '' written by : neil sedaka . written for : carole king , naturally . sedaka and king actually dated briefly in high school -- a romance sedaka was able to successfully milk with `` oh , carol , '' a then top-10 -lrb- if now somewhat forgettable -rrb- 1959 pop song . however , the real success of `` oh , carol '' came a few months later , when it inspired king to write a rebuttal entitled `` oh , neil . '' at the time , king and her husband , gerry goffin , were fledgling songwriters in need of a hit tune . `` oh , neil '' was n't that , but it did pay off . after sedaka gave a tape of the song to his boss , king and goffin landed jobs at the legendary brill building pop music factory , where the duo went on to write chart-toppers like `` will you still love me tomorrow '' and `` the loco-motion . '' 6 . `` it ai n't me , babe '' written by : bob dylan . written for : joan baez , though it clearly was n't the nicest gift dylan could have given her . the two met in 1961 , when baez was an up-and-coming folk singer and dylan was a nobody from minnesota . desperate to make his break in the music biz , dylan worked like crazy to get baez 's attention . he eventually ended up going on tour with her , which is how he first became famous , and also how the two began dating . for a while , they seemed like the golden couple , but things soon went downhill . during a european concert tour together in early 1965 , they had a huge fight and parted ways . that may , dylan was holed up in a hotel after being hospitalized with a virus , and baez , hoping to remain friends , decided to bring him flowers . sadly , that 's how she found out that her ex was already dating someone else . that someone else was sara lownds , whom dylan married a mere six months later . 7 . `` our house '' written by : graham nash -lrb- of crosby , stills , nash & young -rrb- . written for : joni mitchell . in december 1968 , nash and mitchell moved into a cozy little house in the laurel canyon section of los angeles . though commonly left out of the hippy pantheon , laurel canyon was sort of a commune-home away from commune-home for san francisco society -- not just csn&y , but also jim morrison , the eagles , frank zappa , and more . `` our house '' was directly inspired by a lazy sunday in the nash/mitchell household . the couple went out to brunch , hit an antiques store , and then returned to find the house just a bit chilly , at which point nash literally `` lit a fire , '' while mitchell `` placed the flowers in the vase that she bought that day . '' no , really . the whole tableau seemed so ridiculously domestic to nash that he immediately sat down and spent the rest of the day writing about it . e-mail to a friend .
